Friends of decades have fallen for fake news and are actively demonizing the Muslim community. How did we come to this?,21.0,fvyodb,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvyodb/friends_of_decades_have_fallen_for_fake_news_and/,6.0,"The govt of India has failed miserably in protecting doctors nurses sanitation workers in the coronavirus pandemic.
Not enough PPEs, not adequate testing.
We are testing 27 per million
Compared to 67 power million in Pakistan.
Korea is testing more than 7000 per million.

Regarding the Tableeghi jamaat incident in Delhi, few points

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

This was my experience with ""friends"" of twenty years.

How did we come to this?

These Corona virus events are not the best way to judge Modi’s popularity. Hear me out.,20.0,fvxn3m,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvxn3m/these_corona_virus_events_are_not_the_best_way_to/,3.0,"I have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show Modi’s unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy. While it is true Modi is an extremely popular politician, I don’t think these events are the best way to measure it. Here is why:

* To begin with, most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis. This is commonly known as [Rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). (For example, Trump, even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the Corona virus outbreak, has seen an increase in his approval ratings). Sadly, this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power, and that should worry us. ([For Autocrats, and Others, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html))

* Only a small percentage of people understand the semi-political nature of these events. For most people these were non-political events to fight Corona virus. Many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons, including and not limited to love for the country (Rally 'round the flag effect), peer pressure, manufactured consent through media, boredom etc. 

* These events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown (something like this probably wouldn't be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown). People are locked in the house and glued to the TVs. Modi Govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by non-stop media coverage. It didn’t matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks, you couldn’t escape the marketing for these events. Dozens of popular film stars, sportspersons, religious leaders, etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these “non-political” events. I doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for Modi’s other openly political projects like CAA or NRC.

* Many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the God to help fight the virus. Given how religious this country is and the situation we are in, the message was naturally persuasive for many people. **This is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps, not the message of solidarity or politics**. A few news outlets packaged yesterday’s event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked.

* Opposition, whatever little is left, couldn’t openly oppose these events. The either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet. That won’t necessarily be the case under normal circumstances.

* It is my assessment that the **devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on Modi's political future** then these marketing events. A lot of potential political damage to Modi on this would also depend on the performance of Congress as an opposition, and that’s a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party.

* Modi’s popularity is a by-product of a compromised media ecosystem. These PR stunts by Modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again. So, in my view, **it’s the death of independent media that should worry us more than Modi’s popularity, as the latter stems from the former**. Sadly, I don’t see a solution for the media problem anytime soon. On the bright side, Modi’s popularity doesn’t automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party. We have seen that in the recent assembly elections where BJP lost despite major political events like the dilution of the Article 370 and the Ram Mandir verdict.

To conclude – No, 2024 Lok Sabha election results were not announced yesterday.",Politics,False,0.78,"[""I agree most part  but -\n\n\ndeath of independent media was because of Modi sending Income tax notices and withdrawal of revenue generating ads from govt.\n\n\nCommunalisation of this pandemic is due to government intentionally turning a blind eye to such reporting.

So, I've seen a lot of people calling doctors as gods, heroes and saviours right?

Everyday you're working 10-12 hour shifts, barely getting any rest, all while an uncertainty looms in the back of your head if you are even going to get through this pandemic alive. Then you see all these people doing all kinds of weird shit and cheering you on to walk in to that death trap again. How would you feel?

Are We Hypocrite Inherently?,12.0,fvt6j5,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvt6j5/are_we_hypocrite_inherently/,8.0,"Okay. So I see myself amidst a society where people live a double life. One life is the personal one, and the other they think they and everyone around is supposed to live (but the fact that they don't live it and are ignorant of it). I'll give you some examples of it. 
1) In between these ""QUARANTIMES"", we see people on social media arguing about who is wrong and who is right for every step that govt takes, and therefore they split people into two groups (National and Anti-national). Instead of thinking about the notion of a simple idea like torching lights, they fight over and make jokes about the people who won't do it and to the extent of bullying them. They act as if they care so much about the nation that they won't let that person become anti-nationalist, change his thinking and be a help for the country. Mind it, it's all happening on the social media, but in the real-life you'll see the same set of people breaking the rules, throwing away garbage here and there, when asked about justifying their these acts lead to a "" kya fark padta hai"" attitude. Do they do this just because they want to show other people?
2) I am a student at a premier institute. Most of my classmates live a double life when it comes to academics.

Scientific temper vs Faith,38.0,fvrv9a,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvrv9a/scientific_temper_vs_faith/,9.0,"The following is an excerpt from a 1988 article on ""How to do research, at the MIT AI Lab"" (Link to the full article given at the end of this post). The following excerpt is about how to read a research paper:

```
Read with a question in mind. ""How can I use this?"" ""Does this really do what the author claims?"" ""What if...?"" 
```

The above, is what scientific temper is all about. It gives us the option of questioning everyone and everything. This has been drilled into me and other researchers by our respective research advisers - to never accept anything until you can prove it to yourself, until you can convince yourself of the validity of the idea presented in a research paper. No matter how successful/popular the author of the paper is, no matter how well cited a paper is, don't trust the presented results until you can prove it to yourself - either by deriving the proof yourself or by writing the code, doing the experiments and reproducing the results yourself.

A scientific temper teaches you to question everyone - from your parents, then your teachers, to your Governments. 

The reason this is not easy, is because it requires you to have an ego big enough to say ""everything is wrong until I verify it"" and simultaneously a humility big enough to say ""I was wrong"" when a mistake is pointed out. 

In the political scenario, you have Governments and followers indulging in fear-mongering to keep people in tow. You see fake videos spreading hatred and phobia that are easily debunked. You see Governments telling you that there are terror elements that intend to destroy the country - while a simple database lookup will show that on average, annually, less than 60 people die from cross-border terrorism of all kinds in India. 

Option 1, is to blindly believe anything your Government says. Option 2, is to put a lot of effort into investigating it yourself. 

Option 1 is about having faith, akin to following a religion. Its about clapping and lighting candles, while having blind faith that everything will be alright, no questions asked. Its about mindlessly chanting ""All is Well"" as portrayed in that (ironically) idiotic movie.
This option, leads to a faith based Governance - do nothing, have faith in us. 

Option 2 is about seeking the truth for yourself by exploration and collecting your own data samples. Its about being constantly updated and asking, rather nagging them, with questions like ""when will a mass testing program begin?"". 
This option, leads to people-driven Governance where we hold the decision-making power at every step of the way and the government only holds tools to execute those decisions.

More power to you, me, everyone.

Those of us who feel this way should just stop participating in or even addressing these theatrics and as a bonus, plan and execute our own small scale activities. Activities which will keep the sheeple indoors, out of trouble and prevent them from spreading misinformation or anything. The fact that much of the country doesn't give a damn about what the PM or any other influential person or celebrity says should be enough to shut them up and make them focus solely on the pandemic.

The media won't stop addressing this shit, the celebrities will keep spreading nonsensical things and other bad things will continue to happen. 
I think what we, as responsible and sane citizens, should do is this:

1) Just follow the WHO and govt guidelines regarding safety and health. 
2) Stop addressing anything the govt, the celebrities or any influencers say that doesn't focus on facts or logical steps regarding the covid-19 situation. Don't address any gestures or encouraging words from them. 
3) Come up with fun activities to engage yourselves and your neighbours to save them from participating in mindless behaviour. 

Even if small pockets of our population do this instead of submitting to whatever our leaders push on us, it'll be a victory.

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.

Our Government is a master in distracting people from the tel question, is this the same. As I see people celebrating this moment and not asking about the real question here why are we doing this? I asked my family members and some friends they all said it’s a Mini Diwali. Today lord Ram killed the Meghanath so we all are celebrating. 

Well that’s funny isn’t it? In my personal opinion this moment is just used to distract people coz in recent 3 to 4 days the daily new COVOD19 cases are more than 500+. And reports are emerging from across the India that doctors don’t have enough PPE they are not being treated well by the officials and the people they are treating. Some media houses is saying that government is not providing reliable data on the no of cases and the measures taken by them to tackle Coronavirus. Also the reason behind the new fund PM Cares is also not clear as the PM relief fund already has more than 3,400+ Cr. Rupees. And how government is using the money from PM Cares. These are just small questions which we really do need to ask from the government and they don’t want to answer that. 

So,  we really need to ask is that is this was really necessary or it’s just a new propaganda by government to hide its tracks like previous many. 
I’m not saying this is bad or you shouldn’t do it I’m saying we really need to focus on the real problem which is coronavirus in this case. Celebrate and ask.

What I've learned in my recent time here is the basic looking up profiles by searching , mass mailing, Job posting, etc. I have access to naukri and monster portals. Currently it mostly just involves dealing with passive candidates, and only getting a few interested here and there via calling. How can i make an effort to get more active candidates and more relevant ones?  


Also dealing with people in remote or rural areas, where people don't have good communication skills in English, or even in Hindi (south India, etc). Such areas also have a scarce amount of profiles on job portals or applicants. What would be the ways to get profiles of interested job seekers in such areas.  


The main issue is the setup daily profile targets, which let me say i don't have any problem with , but the fact that others (""experienced people"")  for some reason like to send irrelevant profiles or one that anyone will reject, while i try for more quality profiles and am more interested in resolving the recruitment process without anyone having trouble and the whole thing being beneficial to the candidate. (I know, what a pipe dream!. Not the way thing works and what not.)  
Also the fact that i am a fresher and am not efficient currently.

I have recently come to know that my college is going to convert my hostel to an isolation ward.

We hostel occupants are against this decision. They are breaking in our room by breaking our locks. Many of us have our precious belongings like documents and gadgets. They've said they will empty our rooms, collect our stuff and store it some polythene and store all that in some common area.  I took all my belongings with me except some of my documents (Mark-sheets etc) and I fear that they are going to get lost. Some of us have left much more like a whole desktop, laptops and other expensive things.

Our college officials can barely run a college properly and most of us reckon that this is going to end in a massive disaster where many of us loose our belongings.

All of this decision was taken without any prior notice. Not even a slightest hint. Most of were informed by word of mouth by our college mates.

I respect that our college is taking initiative and helping in this tough time but this isn't the way.

Some of the colleges got an order from DM to convert the hostel into an isolation ward but our college isn't required to convert hostel rooms into isolation ward because we didn't receive any notice.

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years. Is the phenomena of hikikomori different in India? I know many in our country are unemployed. Where do such people live? Are they truly socially reclusive? How do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? How do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? What can people do to identify such behaviors? What triggered it for you? Is there a way to curb such triggers?

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis.

A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly.

Looking information about a caste or tribe ‘Changar’,5.0,fv89dt,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv89dt/looking_information_about_a_caste_or_tribe_changar/,0.0,"Hello

The Changar tribe can be found in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia but they speak a language related to Rajasthani Marwari, Braj or Haryanvi. 

They must have migrated from North India to Punjab and then to Peshawar and Afghanistan and beyond. Along the way other low-status communities joined with them, some speaking Punjabi but assimilated together for socio-cultural regions. 

According to Wikipedia, “In India, The Changar are largely a landless community, with a few still involved in their traditionally occupation of lime manufacture. Most are now daily wage labourers. Like other Rajasthani Muslims, the community has a caste association or biradari panchayat, which resolves intra community disputes and enforces communal norms. Although the Changar live in close proximity to other such Muslim castes such as the Hiranbaz, Sindhi-Sipahi and Qaimkhani, intermarriages between them and the Changar are extremely rare. The Changar are Sunni Muslims, and their customs are similar to other Rajasthani Muslims. They have been granted Other Backward Class status, which makes them subject to a number of affirmative actions policies of the Government of India”

This part I believe is true: According to their traditions, the Changar left Rajasthan, with their initial settlement being in the districts of Bikaner, Churu and Nagaur. From there the Changars migrated to Sindh. A further migration then took place to Punjab, where many are still found. They speak Marwari among themselves, and Urdu with outsiders. 

However it is dubious to claim that many of them migrated to Persia in the Sasanian Empire, from there to Sasanian Egypt to Byzantine Empire, where there descendant's became known today as the Romani people in Turkey, who live mainly in East Thrace.[1]

"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",382.0,fv9ifd,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,62.0,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES

Must Read : The plight of the Indian Farmer,30.0,fv88qa,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv88qa/must_read_the_plight_of_the_indian_farmer/,1.0,"A few hundred miles from South Asia's glamour capital: Mumbai, a new day is marked by the lifeless body of another Indian farmer dangling from a peepul tree by a noose. More than 200,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last decade in Maharashtra's Vidarbha alone, an area the size of Portugal in central India. However, being an admirer of only the beautiful, the middle class Indian and their news, is carefully sanitized of any mention about these starving, sun-burnt wretches that cannot even afford the diet provided to one commercial European cow. The Indian farmer is invisible in life and in death. Thus, while his ripe, turgid oranges reach the gentleman's table, this abomination of a human being vanishes into obscurity, thrashed and ravaged by a burden of debt as the content hungry Indian media looks at the shopping malls and celebrity gossip to fill their pages.

I do not intend to ruin the appetite of my fine, educated compatriots on this forum, by whining the demise of a two penny cotton, orange farmer from India, I am here to enlighten you all on the ways of making these useless deaths profitable: the Monsanto way!

In the 1990s, Monsanto, ventured into India with its variety of genetically modified cotton seeds: BT cotton. In this introductory episode, I would skip the illegalities of Monsanto's field trials in India for which the Indian supreme court suspended Monsanto's Indian trading rights until 2001.

Fast forward to 2002: Monsanto's agents start approaching Vidarbha's farmers about these BT cotton seeds (later known as suicide seeds). The seeds were expensive, but Monsanto had already arranged with Indian banks for huge loan provisions to farmers who agreed. The farmers were promised unimaginable profits from these super-seeds, mostly verbally. Most importantly, Monsanto's agents were nice, personable and they actually addressed the Indian farmers as if they were human beings. When you are nice to the poor, you take away their bargaining power. Unable to read or write, these gullible, uneducated farmers put their thumb-print (in lieu of their signature) on Monsanto's agreement and approached banks for loans several times their annual revenue. The loans were all approved without any hurdle. The farmer was literally on a joyride, for the first time in several generations.

In the eyes of the erudite, this was a picture perfect move. In one sweep, millions of dollars of public money lying in the local banks became Monsanto's money, riding on shoulders of half-naked cotton farmers of Vidarbha.

Then reality struck: the crops failed, they failed miserably. When the farmers approached the same agents for answers, the attitude was different from last time. The agents pointed the illiterate farmer, who is unable to even sign his name, to a clause built into page x, line y of the initial document. The clause redeemed Monsanto of failed harvest unless the farmer had also bought Monsanto's very expensive fertilizer and pesticide as well. The news broke as hellfire on the destitute farmer that was already on the brink of devastation from three failed cotton harvests. There was no way for the farmer to afford these expensive fertilizers and pesticides.

Obviously, when the farmers approached the banks and local politicians on Monsanto's payroll, both referenced the same documents with the thumb print of the farmers and held the farmer alone responsible for their debt.

If you have decided to read on, let me warn you that there is no silver lining.

Until now, after each harvest, the farmers would save their indigenous seeds in local seed banks, but they have not sown indigenous for past several harvest cycles. So the older variety of indigenous seeds that the farmer sowed, are no longer to be found and worse still: Monsanto has bought over all the local seed banks. 99% of cotton exported by India is BT cotton, the indigenous varieties are all but extinct. These were the same indigenous cotton varieties that once clad Alexander’s army, the ancient Romans and the Egyptian Pharaohs. The native Indian cotton that led Europe into a global exploration for trade routes and set forth the age of explorations - is all but gone.

At this point, the Vidarbha farmers give up the fight, decide to swallow their loss and make the best of what they have. In the absence of indigenous seeds, they moved to sow the seeds from the previous Monsanto harvest. However, the friendly Monsanto agent came knocking back. The agent pointed again to another clause in the agreement that declares Monsanto's patent on the seeds and prohibits the farmers from re-sowing them. The farmer is flabbergasted, never before had they known that seeds can be patented. Farmer lobby groups took Monsanto to court. Obviously Monsanto prevailed.

Monsanto's victory over the naked starving Indian farmers was hugely celebrated in various disguise. Our very own Nature called it a ""boost for research"". 

The patriotic, nationalistic Modi government refuses to talk about farmer suicides. For several years, it refused to publish the suicide numbers. In Nov 2018 when a huge rally of Indian farmers marched to Delhi begging for their justice and relief, they were flogged and shot at by the Indian police, and not one mainstream Indian media covered the story.

The memoirs of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India 1773-85, describes the Indian famine caused by atrocious policies of another multinational corporation: The British East India Trading Company (EIC). Starving farmers would come to the city in the vain hope of finding leftovers discarded by the opulent employees of EIC. Starving and diseased, the Indian farmers are an ungainly sight for three centuries now. As the British sepoy would kick these wretched souls lining the street side, the farmer would cry out in agony: ""Baba!, baba!"": ""father, father"","" your countrymen have brought me to such misery, if it pleases you, I want to breath my last in your presence"".

He and other volunteers with him are risking their lives to feed thousands of poor people. They are stepping up where the government is failing it's citizens, they are risking infection when we are sitting at home as if it's a vacation. 

A few days ago the solicitor general of India put up fake and baseless allegations against Harsh Mander,the allegations were that Mr Maser had made derogatory comments that brought disrepute to the Supreme Court , the chief justice did not even hear to Harsh Mander's Lawyer and scolded Harsh Mander for bringing disrepute to the Supreme Court, they scolded him without even reading his speech and just based on what the solicitor general said. These allegations against Mr Mander was made after he made complaints of hate speeches during the Delhi Riots.

Excerpts from the hearing:
the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said: “If this is what you feel about the Court, then we will have to decide what to do about you.” He also decided to defer a hate speech petition presented by Mander. “Till we sort this out we will not hear you but will hear others.”

Mander’s lawyer, Dushyant Dave, pleaded with the judges: “Please go through the entire speech … the filing of the application by Delhi Police against Mander is an attempt to browbeat him … He is being put in the dock for nothing.” But, again, the Court did not hear the full speech. It continued to rely on the Solicitor General’s version now, presumably, supported by the police. And it ordered Mander to respond to the allegations and fixed an April date for the next hearing.

I request Indians to please write an email to both the solicitor general and the Chief Justice of India. The email should be polite courteous and should have 100% accuracy of facts. Please write in the email that Mr Mander has been doing great service to the nation and such treatment of him is not appreciated by the citizens.

So I have this really close friend who's having severe mental breakdowns, and I feel like its gonna get worse as this lockdown stretches since he has a history of depression. The isolation involved has served to only exacerbate his condition. I have been trying to be there for him and do what I can, but even that has its limits since there is only so much I can do on video call or on call. I have seen him progressively get worse with time during the last 9-10ish days. I have also been hearing him say that he wishes I was with him since I am one of the few people that boosts his mood and spirits up. I am also one of the few people that is privy to this since I kind of back him up and he seems to cheer up when I am with him, and we have been there for each other through thick and thin.

I'm trying to figure out a way to get from Noida (since that is where I put up) to Delhi, so that I can keep him company and ensure he doesn't do something to himself during the remainder of the lockdown. He does not stay with family, which is another cause for concern. He lives in one of the localities in South Delhi hence, with these border restrictions and the lack of a car, getting there currently seems impossible for me. I have asked some friends as well, but I do not have any contacts that would fall within the essential service providers' subset. Please do help if possible, I will really be indebted. If you have any questions or doubts that you believe are making you refrain from providing assistance in this case, feel free to ask them in the comments or on PM. Will try my best to answer.

How bout quad-nation aircraft carrier for IOC,13.0,fuv5y8,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuv5y8/how_bout_quadnation_aircraft_carrier_for_ioc/,7.0,"# How bout a Quad-nation Aircraft Carrier Strike Group?

***By: Kartikeya Semwal***

With the ever-increasing threat posed by China’s PLA Navy in the IOC (Indian Ocean Region), neighbouring countries like Japan, South Korea and Australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. Till now, none of these countries has an operational Aircraft Carrier (AC). Instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or ALS (Amphibious Landing Ships).

[INS Vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

But more than them, India feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 Aircraft Carriers (ACs). Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[India's Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

Guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn’t have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China’s power projection through it’s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. 

[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

Indian Navy’s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India’s 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.

[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

But there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China’s PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. 

  

[F-35 B taking off from US Aircraft Carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)

One point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin’s F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce’ modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. 

But again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won’t be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won’t be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft). 

[F\/A-18 Super Hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)

On the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won’t mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy’s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts. 

[JSDF \(Japan\) Navy Ships during Malabar Exercise with India.](https://preview.redd.it/nfgdxqrhftq41.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db24b91d1148a6ea32964162d21cd14b4c83df3)

Now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.",Science/Technology,False,0.84,"[""Japan is under US military umbrella, not to mention that US has bases in all these countries..they don't need us."", ""Don't you think we need hospitals and schools/ colleges more than we need aircraft carriers?

A little bit about me ever since I was 9yrs old I have been a fan of animation ( anime in particular ) and through various trials in my life from not been able to draw a simple circle to convince my parents to let me choose animation as my career path I have come a long way (I mean for me atleast) 

I don't know how to explain this feeling but for the past couple of days (7-10maybe) I have been very down , depressed , my heart aches daily like there's a hand grabbing my heart pressing it what not and I have even cried a lot before going to sleep ( silently although I wanted to shout at the top of my head but couldn't as it would wake my parents ) 

What I am trying to say maybe is that I am currently feeling as if I don't know anything about animation be it 2d or 3d ..everyday I keep on practicing and learning and try to do my best but it never feels enough and I am worried sick what will I do after I graduate ( I am in my 2nd year if college ) 

The thing is I am self taught because I failed my NID and DUFA exam mainly because I have been practicing art digitally since I was in 9-10th standard or so and the exams where in traditional medium my dad asked if I wanted to go for a private uni for arts but I declined the offer because I was told by a couple of people and professional that it's pretty much useless and I chose one of the easiest course in DU in the hopes that I will have a lot of free time to teach myself and spare money to buy equipment if necessary (my fee is only 27000 for 3years)  both of these things came true I do have a a lot of time and my fee is not much .

I knew this was a risky move getting into a course that's not related to animation ( it is, if u thing of it as a business because I do want to have my own studio and it does kinda help ) and I believed a lot in myself that I will do good but apparently I haven't ! As much as I want to tell my parents that I am scared as to what I would do in the future, I just can't because it won't help me and would only stress them because they will start worrying and it's not like they know anything about animation and would start making calls for knowledge and help ..I don't want to give them that kind of a stress right now .

I should also mention this I do plan to do a 6 month diploma on animation and fine arts after I graduate respectively 

The reason I made this post is because I wanted to let go of this feeling JUST LET ME OUT. And get a good couple of advice from people who are in the Animation industry as to how it works and stuff and get in touch with them , get some advice from people to resolve this feeling and most importantly to find myself a mentor who couple give me tasks to do this and that either weekly or monthly and later review my works and broadly point my mistakes and give me some direction 

All the hard-work would come from me but I need someone to guide me ! YouTube videos would never point out my mistake and I need someone to I guess

I will link my best works at the end.

I have figured I work best when someone gives me deadline to work with. I just need someone to tell me who actually has knowledge to from either school or industry to give me assignment and nothing more I will find what that things means etc etc and just review my work at the end .

I beg you if you thing you have that kind of knowledge and can spare 30-40min a week or a month please help this stranger ( I told my name in the beginning because I believe one stops thing of you as a complete stranger if they know your name ) 

You don't even have to give me your phone number or email address we can talk directly on Reddit message or Instagram or Facebook or any other app that you might thing is comfortable ( in case this message looks like a scam) 

But I beg you if you can spare a couple of minutes a week or a month to help me please do although I don't have anything to give in return but I would be ever grateful for your help.

PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN.

I think government can't extend this complete lockdown much given the economic cost to such a decision.

According to WHO Indian government is looking for time with lockdown of 21 days which means India was to get prepared with specialised rooms and wards for covid19 patients,ventilators,ppe,quality masks if not N95 ,working supply chains of all essential items,trainings of armed forces and medical practitioners.

More testing would result in more checks and readiness which was lacking till now.Recent approval of indigenous testing kits by Ms Minal D Bhonsale of Mylab which could give result in 2.5hrs is a welcome step and will help in giving clear picture of the crisis. South Korea and Singapore could contain the crisis only because of more tests and precautions thereafter.

There is also a hope from MIT led research which proved that continous temperature of 35deg could halt the virus spread.According to IMD officials the temperature would continously increase in comming days.

If Padma Bhushan Dr Nageshwar Reddy is to be believed, ”Most important thing is that when this virus spread to say Italy or the US or to India, the genotypes of this virus turned out to be different. Sequencing of the whole virus has been done in four countries — the first in the USA, second in Italy, third in China and fourth in India.

What they are finding is that this virus has a different genome sequencing in India compared to say Italy. This has a lot of significance because in the Indian virus, there is a single mutation occuring in the spike protein of the genome. Spike protein is the area that attaches to the human cell. One small mutation has happened, making that attachment weak. So, this will become an important factor for us in India”

A total lockdown for a month would take 8.5% of GDP.Fiscal deficit would further down 4.7% and NPA more than 11%.

According to Raghuram Rajan.“This is a very serious concern because not only does the lockdown keep people from going to work, it keeps them at home which is not necessarily that pristine isolated place, but can also be a slum where people live together,”

It is very important for India to not reach stage 3 of community transmission.If stringent measures are to be taken government must not shy away from doing so. Lockdown must be for school/universities,your travel,holidays,park,clubs,functions of gatherings etc and people of 50+ age must not be allowed to come out.

We must be hopeful for the above factors of temperature and genome sequencing and keep our fingers crossed for ours and health of our fellow citizens.",AskIndia,False,0.84,"[""Ideally, it should be extended. But, we can't be sure with the present government."", 'They should extend the Lockdown at least till April end, the number of cases have been increasing in the last couple of days.

3-i want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on (like Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata (3rd Movement)) which should also be fine on yamaha right?

3- Do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity ? most indian sites say ""does not come with bluetooth"" which i sort of need. anyone in india purchased this?

We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT),80.0,fupeo0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fupeo0/we_would_have_gone_into_a_recession_regardless_of/,21.0,"People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time.

India's internet shutdown laws must be reformed!,335.0,fuomw7,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuomw7/indias_internet_shutdown_laws_must_be_reformed/,6.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zy87u6z1uqq41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b456dedb4224dca0f38034a8c4be6011624aaf

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to ensure reform of India’s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### Background

On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework.  The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.

The government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   


### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications

We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*

Noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs

We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

We recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.

As per the article in [Businesstoday.in](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-impact-50-restaurants-to-shutdown-if-lockdown-extends-till-may/story/399903.html) which is regarding the restaurant survival during the lock-down period in India it is said that:

**50% restaurants to shut if lockdown extends; Zomato, Swiggy business down 10% :** Only 5-6 restaurant chains have enough cash reserves to sustain more than a month, the sector will need government's help if there's no improvement after May.

Well, their is always a brighter side of the story! and this lockdown period can well utilized for all the research and development for the new market. Yes! you read it correct, it is going to be a fresh and new market, for you and your current restaurant too. So what does a new comer in the market does? What pre-launch preparation he does ? What he wants to boast about before and after the launch? 

Lemme tell you if you want to survive in this new market once this Covid-19 lockdown in India is over, you have to work upon one and only ONE thing and it is your RE-BRANDING & MARKETING! Yes, people must NOT forget your name from the market! and people must know what you are going to offer after the market is open. Obviously you are going to bank upon takeaway orders initially for few weeks or can be a month or two! Now when you know about this right now, then you can always cut short your staffing according to the needs of a take-away joint. Service guys can be asked to work on stipends for a month or can be motivated for the salary in coming month in part payments. Good ones will stay with you! Don't worry. 

DO NOT worry about staffing for next few months at-least, because their will be plenty of manpower available, filtered out from those restaurants who did not survived the impact. A great possibility of salary negotiation too. 

Work upon the ZERO waste menu. Do some research, ZERO waste menu is something where the only food waste is the stuff which once cannot digest or is toxic/not recommended to eat. For planned ZERO waste menu you may contact here and you might get some professional help if needed. 

Get a nice air purifier and alkaline water purifier if possible. Why? well apart from the health benefits, this thing is going to help you a lot in your re-launch event, how? We gonna talk in points mentioned below in a while. Their are hotel grades version for kitchen and guest area as cheap as 40k . 

Try to arrange your in-house delivery guy, so that you can save upon the commissions from Swiggy & Zomato, as their will be good number of delivery orders, saving upon the commission can save you your one month electricity bill for sure! Will tell you the ways to promote your own contact .

NOW: All is set you have done all of the above mentioned points, asked your landlord to waive off your rent and luckily he agreed! :) 

Its 10 days left now before lockdown gets over, what next? 

BOOST YOUR INTERNET / INSTAGRAM / YOUTUBE / FACEBOOK WITH ALL THE ENERGY YOU GOT! 

Now its time to hit hard with a well planned hospitality grade digital marketing campaign which is going to make your customers and as well as the potentially new customers about the things you have got for them once the market is open.

Its time to showcase your new ZERO waste menu with cool offers, you are going to shout about the healthy environment your outlet is going to offer to your staff as well as the people who walk in, you are going to boast about the alkaline way of cooking meals, you are going to boast about all the reasons you have for your existing customers as well as new customers to visit. 

A WELL PLANNED DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TAILORED FOR HOTEL AND RESTAURANT NEEDS IS AN ONLY WAY WHICH CAN HELP YOU GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND HELP YOU SURVIVE THE CRASH.  

WHEN HIRING ANY DIGITAL MEDIA EXPERT, ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF HOTEL/RESTAURANT OR F&B SECTOR. Why? Because if they know the 01s of F&B industry then they will be able to target your clients, menu promotions, promotions of your other food services easily. You just need to tell them WHAT YOU WANT. Rest you can leave all upon them, the deals, promo etc too, remember the points mentioned above, and don't worry! Situation is all fine, what is required ? a bit of creativity and vision.

2) the BJP has only gone and done it again and communalised the issue. we have somehow made this the tablighi janata outbreak and have pinned everything on that when there are massive clusters of people meeting in ayodhya or BJP ministers in the south holding pujas. my point isn't ""oh look at hindus"", it's the fact that religion is irrelevant and any sort of public gathering is detrimental to us. the Media and the BJP are only focusing on the muslims further propagating the narrative that this is something which they are spreading and portraying them as the enemy of the state. 

3) Subramaniam Swamy and his Vice interview have highlighted the BJPs agenda in a crystal clear manner. I have personally never voted for the BJP (including in 2014) as I was always aware of the RSS manifesto that drove their agenda and now we are finally seeing 90+ years of systematic, indoctrinated bigotry become fully a part of the central government's agenda. But what is truly horrifying is going through the comments of the Vice video and watching all these bhakts condemning Vice and telling them to ""stop with social justice"" and going ahead and justifying the BJPs agenda. the bots of the BJP have gotten exactly what they wanted through such a government, these sort of exclusionary policies are not outrageous to their base but are exactly the platform the BJP has run on since the Gujarat model. They are really out here partying like it's 2002. 

through all of this there is one plea i make of you, please hold your leaders accountable. when it comes to Covid, the one thing that is obvious is that this is only the start for India. Bhakts will have their reality check because as this virus spreads it is completely indiscriminate. it will affect them, it will kill their parents, it will kill their children, it will kill them, just as much as it could kill my family, me, your family, or a mUsLiM. as the number of infections and deaths rise in India, it is our duty to consistently hold our leaders responsible for acting. do not blame anyone else. not the tabhligi jamaat goers, not the ones who went to ayodhya, hold your elected officials accountable. they are making this a communal issue when this disease is going to kill irrespective of religion. 

i write this as someone with a lot of time on their hands but a lot of angst and anxiety in my mind because of the obvious direction this country is moving towards (Covid or no Covid). but this extraordinary time provides us with the opportunity to truly test our leaders and hold them responsible for the course our country takes. i honestly want to do a lot more and genuinely find an avenue to express this sort of discontent that is not just limited to like minded people like me. I know that places like reddit and instagram can be echo chambers in a lot of ways and i want to actively break out of that. 

If any of you share similar concerns but genuinely have ideas on how we can consolidate please message me or comment. we have the time and we have the modes, the one thing that the government cannot stop is a digital movement. the only point is we have to consolidate and act uniformly. 

what do you think is the way forward for a group of disenfranchised citizens who genuinely care about the future of this country? what are ways you think we could call out major media outlets or officials in a legitimate way? what do you think are basic principles which we have to hold our officials up to?",Politics,False,0.82,[],False,False,False,False,True,True
We are facing one of the most challenging times in human history. We are facing one of the most severe medical crises since WW1 which will have economic effects that may rival or exceed the great depression. In such a time there is global deffecit of leadership from Modi in India to Trump in America,44.0,funp0c,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/funp0c/we_are_facing_one_of_the_most_challenging_times/,14.0,"There is a global crises of leadership. Under Trump and his America first policy, America has receded from the world stage leaving space for China, space which China used to gain influence over the WHO, the current chief of the WHO always had a favourable standing with China, with his rival for the chairmanship of the WHO Dr David Nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current WHO chief has close contacts with China and it's leadership. These allegations are further reaffirmed when the WHO chief went to Wuhan on the 13th of January 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the Corona Virus. The above events show Trump's failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage. Trump also took the Corona Virus very very lightly, downplaying the intelligence over the same provided by his own national agencies, he has previously ignored serious advisories by his national agencies, for example Russia's interference in US elections and the Khashguni murders. 

Now coming to India, no political party in India has ever worked on the health infrastructure, other than a few marquee projects like building one or two AIIMS. This is the same for this government as well, however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities. Currently India has .8 doctors per thousand patients, which is well below recommended standard. I'm sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to AYUSH doctors.

When the Delhi state government, started to build Mohalla Clinics, then the current ruling national government tried it's best to stop their development, the D.D.A, which is controlled by the Central Government, didn't alot them any land, forcing Mohalla Clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins. As they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. Now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the Corona Virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in South Korea.

The question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in Hungary.

Edit: I would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in India also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in India, it's doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the Supreme Court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having Covid19. Couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.

Edit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of N95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries. In fact a shipment of N95 which was just transiting through a U.S. port ""disappeared"", the shipment was heading to Germany.

Is Trump crazy, he is isolating America and Americans at their time of greatest needs. For example Germany is a major industrial power, it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of Ventilators, what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards? Canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from Windsor Ontario to North American cities like Detroit.

They conduct loud Pujas during Navratra, twice a day. They conduct havans, Jaaps, Jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. Our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. 

When they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, I can hear them yell at each other - ALL DAY LONG. They call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. Nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

This made me think - What's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general?

Will lighting a candle matter?,2.0,fudp5g,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fudp5g/will_lighting_a_candle_matter/,4.0,"It was the 10th day of the Nationwide Lockdown imposed by the government to control the spread of Coronavirus which began on 25th March. It was announced a day earlier that our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation through a short video message. Everyone started anticipating what the message could be considering that when Prime Minister last addressed the nation he called for a nationwide lockdown.

But when the Prime minister addressed the nation he urged on 5th April at 9PM for all of us to stand on our doorway or balconies switch off the lights and for nine minutes light a candle, Diya, torch or your mobiles with an aim to fight the darkness spread by coronavirus with light. He further said If everyone lights one diya each, then we will realise the power of that light. we will be able to highlight the objective for which we all are fighting together. He also requested everyone not to assemble in roads and maintain social distancing. He also appreciated people for setting an example of discipline and service. Prime Minister also said that when millions of people are enclosed inside their homes, there must be some who must be asking how can they alone fight this battle against covid-19? We are not alone. This is the power of 130 crore people. This awareness gives us motivation, gives us a goal and gives us the energy to achieve them, it further clears our path. Friends, amidst this darkness caused by coronavirus epidemic we need to constantly pursue to reach towards the light.

This was undoubtedly one of the shortest messages of Prime minister barely lasting 11 minutes and It surprised many when they expected a more action-oriented announcement rather than a symbolic gesture as lighting a candle. We must recall the earlier symbolic call for people to thank everyone involved in fighting the coronavirus on 22nd of March by clapping for them.

When the Prime minister clearly mentioned that the reason for the call for this symbolic gesture was solely to dispel the darkness caused by the epidemic. This was not enough for most of us to find alternative reasons behind this.

We, humans, have a high tendency to fill in the blanks when there is not much information available regarding an issue. Many Linked numerology behind 9Pm and 9 Minutes assuming that the Prime Minister chose the date and time after considering all the astrological logic behind it. Numerous social media posts were immediately created and shared widely and at the same time, there were sceptics to voice their views saying that instead of gimmicks government must concentrate on practical ways to fight the pandemic.

Also, some people who always believed that the Prime minister imposed his religious beliefs reasoned that he stressed the number 9 which holds its very own religious significance and asked not to step out of the house for the so-called demonic exercise. Below is one such social media post which was widely circulated among the certain community.

Be it Navaratri or Navagrahas, 9 is a significant part of Hinduism. They also believe that the mother goddess waged a war for 9 days against the rakshasas for deliverance. Hence the number 9 and the belief that by lighting diyaa, candles for 9 mins everything will go away. Mr Modi has earlier too asked all Indians to bang their plates n glasses in appreciation for the medical professionals which again had a Hindu belief attached to it, to ward off evil. He is a religious leader for many but we have a spiritual author n perfector in Christ Jesus and hence church pls do not fall prey and step out of your homes for this demonic exercise. Be wise and learn to read between the lines. Stay in your homes, let your lights be on and have a good time of family prayer from 9pm on 5th April and make sure you exceed 9 mins

There is no denying the fact the government and health care workers ought to do the practical things necessary to fight the spread of coronavirus and moreover, the government must support the people impacted by the hardships due to the Lockdown.

However, it is also true that we must not forget that a person can be killed not only by the virus but also due to the negativity that we are surrounded by. With the way, the information that comes their way about the havoc caused by the coronavirus there are many people who get very depressed. People die being depressed and their numbers are often not counted the way the people that are dying due to coronavirus.

There are many physical ways to do the same as exercise, Declaration/Incantation/Affirmation, music and lighting a candle, dia is no doubt one such way to change our state of mind. Many of us would be constrained to do any other activity right now and there is no doubt that this symbolic gesture is a simple thing that we can do along with our countrymen showing solidarity against the challenge that we are fighting against.

It is your own choice whether to do it or not and you can also fill the gap by saying that it is not in sync with your religious beliefs. Whatever be the reason and even if the prime minister called for this exercise after considering various factors as being alleged I don`t see any harm in doing what he asked us to do. What harm will it have if you light a candle? I cannot digest any messages of conspiracy theories in this regard. The only harm I can foresee is if you have too much hand sanitizer in your hand while lighting the candle or dia.

Most of us would have stayed in their homes for the past 10 days and it is quite natural for people to feel depressed and uncertain about what the future has in store for them. The most anyone can do to fight the coronavirus is do nothing and stay in the house.

Let us Kill the virus called Negativity at the same time when we fight Coronavirus.

According to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.\n\n> ""Several of these videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in India,"" the 22-page report, which the Delhi Police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.\n\n> ""Our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising Muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill Muslims,"" a senior police official said.\n\n> According to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.\n\n> ""While analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,"" he said.\n\n> ""Considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,"" the report says.\n\n> According to the investigation, Chinese-owned video sharing app TikTok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus. These videos are further being shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.\n\n> Videos of Muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same, the report says.\n\n> Religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown, it adds.\n\n> Authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in Madhya Pradesh\'s Indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in Delhi because of a gathering held by a Muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country.\n\n> In the investigation into the Delhi congregation, the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group Tablighi Jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as ""a conspiracy to keep Muslims away from fellow Muslims"".\n\n> Since then, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease.\n\n> ""We have to take precautions, follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places.

I am currently a final year student in a local state level government college in my city. The lesser said about my college, the better. I guess hell would be better than this sorry excuse of a college. During my 12th, like every engineering aspirant, I wanted to get into any IIT or NIT. But I had taken no coaching, so I had no guidance and messed up my counselling. In the end, I was offered a north eastern NIT. I was hesitant to go there. I wanted to take a drop, but my parents did not agree to it. So I took admission in a govt college in my city and stayed in my home, and prepared alongside college.

I was not able to perform well in JEE-Mains, but secured a rank in top 7k in JEE advanced and got IIT Varanasi Metallurgical in last round. Though I was not satisfied with my result, I was satisfied with an IIT seat. But my parents did not allow me to change college. According to them, metallurgical at even an old IIT was way worse than electrical branch in my current college. I tried to reason with them but to no avail. I was forced to continue in my college. 2nd semester exams overlapped with JEE Advanced date and I performed extremely bad, and got multiple backs.

I was heartbroken. I could not understand how I came to be in my current situation, even after working so hard. I used to wake up at 03:30 in the morning, study from 4 am till 7 am and leave for college at 8 am. I used to skip my lunch and study during lunch break. I returned home around 6 pm, and studied after 7 pm till the time I was extremely exhausted. I used to commute for 2 hours daily, so I revised my notes sitting in autos. Even after giving it my all, I had got only 7k rank in advanced. But now all my efforts were down the drain as I could not even utilize my rank. I felt I was depressed. I am ashamed to say but whenever I was alone, tears started streaming automatically across my face.

My cgpa in first year was extremely bad. To compensate for it, I had to forget my sorrows and start working hard again. I worked moderately hard for next 2 years and increased my percentage to 80. My college has no placements for core branches. So I knew I was on my own. I was confused whether to prepare for Gate or CAT. I had no interest  in engineering or management. In my college, almost all students in core branches prepared for GATE. Although I was not interested in my core subjects, but I started preparing for Gate halfheartedly. On Sundays, to relieve stress, I used to give a mock test of CAT. Solving quant questions somehow relaxed me. I gave CAT 2019 without any expectations. Imagine my surprise when I secured 99.8+ percentile in the exam. I was extremely happy on seeing the result, I had not even calculated my marks before seeing the result.

The GATE exam was in the first week of February, and my IIM A and IIM C interviews were in second week. I could not decide where should I focus. I wasted very valuable time in my state of indecisiveness. At last, I decided to prepare for IIM interviews. I performed badly in my Gate exam as well as my interviews, Looking back, I think that this is all my fault. I had no knowledge about what the IIMs expect from students. I realized the importance of position of responsibility and extra curricular activities after the CAT results. I had nothing to flaunt except my CAT result. I am certain that I would not be able to convert my best calls based on my performance in interviews. Even in Gate, I got 800ish rank which is not good enough for anything, as I am a general candidate.

So now I guess that I will have to drop a year as I have no job and cannot hope to get any, considering the current economic situation. Even after working so hard for the past 6 years in my life, I would be another jobless graduate. It is this thought that eats my heart. I don’t have anything to console myself, to give me motivation.

The streets once again, were silent today
I thanked a god that doesn't exist.
One man spoke, his voice rippling into ignorant cacophony 
Many spoons hitting plates, their mark completely missed.

A plastic covered beam of illumination
Pelted away by the throng
As long as they have religion on their side
They can do, no wrong.

How long before the hate that we hold
Leads us to another holocaust?
Does the rage burn so bright in the face of a faceless prophet
That a fellow helping hand, albeit godless, we vindictively accost?

How many false deities must we worship in beasts?
Bathed in urine, exchanging faith for protection in spite
Of repeated warnings based in flattened blades
Of grass already trampled by this holy blight.

If god really exists, I tell you like this it reside inside
And anybody telling you different,
Just selling you religion
Trying to keep your ass in line

The streets once again were silent today.
This time, I prayed to the god that doesn't exist
That soon I'll be able to hear the children play once more
And that this deafening silence, may soon desist.",Non-Political,False,0.33,[],False,False,False,False,False,True
Has anyone ordered Indane LPG cylinder online? I have some questions about that.,5.0,fu8k8r,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu8k8r/has_anyone_ordered_indane_lpg_cylinder_online_i/,0.0,"I ordered Indane gas cylinder online and chose to do an online payment so I do not have to handle cash. *I usually call the IVRS and make cash payment.*

This is the second time I have booked the cylinder through the app but the first time I made the payment online and that is why I have some question this time.

**THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED:**

The first time I booked the cylinder online I chose not to make an online payment because I wasn't sure about the security of the app and the payment gateway procedure implemented.

The very next day of the booking the ""Invoice"" was created and I was told via SMS that the cylinder will be delivered however It was not delivered and the invoice to my surprise was cancelled and the next day a new one was generated with an excess amount of Rs 150. 

My problem is not with the money but what happened to the cylinder the invoice was generated for? Let's leave that to the side for now. I filed a complain because the cylinder seemed like it would not be delivered in 48 hrs and after the complaint the cylinder was delivered in a rush before the day ended. 

&#x200B;

**THE PRESENT:**

I booked a cylinder on the 2nd April and chose to make an online payment.

I know that the  price of the cylinder changes almost everyday and how something like this is allowed is beyond me.

1. ***My question is:*** since I have already made the payment and it doesn't seem like the cylinder will be delivered today, what happens when the price of the cylinder increases tomorrow?
2. Does it increase for me as well even though I have already made the payment?
3. Am I supposed to give the difference in cash?
4. What is the point in ordering online if the price does change for me and I have to pay the difference in cash?
5. Why is the government allowing this sort of absolute zero competition lazier than sarkari system systems to go on? 

It is diseased and everyone should be moved to piped gas and these ""agencies"" should be taken over by the government and poor should be given the gas for free or at a really low cost. I am deeply regretting refusing the piped gas BUT there is a scam happening there too so I am not really safe in any scenario but at least with this cylinder bs I still have some semblance of control.

I have tried to provide all the information and proof read what I wrote but I am a little stressed due to a lot of factors so I probably have made a few boo boos.

Current approach of testing and forcibly quarantining in state-owned facilities of direct/suspected contacts is a flawed strategy!,20.0,fu7zax,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu7zax/current_approach_of_testing_and_forcibly/,10.0,"The govt. is totally screwing this up by forcibly quarantining families in state-owned facilities. They are directly disincentivizing people from getting tested, and a lot of people would prefer dying at home and faking the cause of death, than going for tests.

The reason is pretty simple. No-one is getting treatment in those quarantine facilities, and the chances of catching something in quarantine is rather high. At the same time people with chronic ailments won't get medicines in the quarantine, will be estranged from their families, and will possibly have no-way to get back home. Neither is this scalable in the long term. And community transmission is definitely here, so contact tracing isn't really gonna buy us much.


Instead mandatory home-quarantine is the way to go (much like the rest of the world).

"During lockdown, Uttarakhand CM (on Amit Shah's orders) arranged 28 buses to transport 1800 Gujarati devotees stranded in Haridwar back to Ahmedabad. Uttarakhand workers in Ahmedabad were then duped of Rs. 18000 and stranded midway when they tried to use these buses to return home.",696.0,fu7wnt,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu7wnt/during_lockdown_uttarakhand_cm_on_amit_shahs/,44.0,"Link to the story: https://www.bhaskar.com/db-original/news/amit-shah-vijay-rupani-latest-updates-on-gujarat-pilgrims-return-from-haridwar-rishikesh-over-coronavirus-lockdown-127094521.html

Since the story is in Hindi, here's a summary of the events as reported by Dainik Bhaskar

>गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

>27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. 

>मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

>मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। 

Instead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway. Some were dropped off in Harayana, and some in Rajasthan. 


> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।

It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

>दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।

On the other hand there are people like Mukesh Kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.

What should be the prayer for an Old person who is dependent on his savings? Should be praying to GOD that Covid -19 come and take away the life or should he be living a beggars life. Well, don’t be shocked with these thought lines. The senior citizen segment is now struggling with falling interest rates which used to be their cash-flow. The impact of Covid -19 is beyond measurable for this segment of society. The ones who are not dependent will face the heat of the same.  Well, I am not here to lecture on financial advisory and how one can save oneself from the impact of low-interest rates. Well, the one for whom I am speaking hardly have the knowledge or adopted efficient financial planning. So it’s better not to showcase the knowledge of FP in this article.

For the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, the interest rate has been cut from 8.6 per cent per annum to 7.4 per cent per annum.

Any financial planning advice will fall short since after the accumulation phase the same corpus needs to be kept in safer assets to get the flow.

This impact is not new to me as we have seen the same in Post 2008 and in the last decade. But this is new to those who are in the elderly senior citizen segment. The savings rate has come down and hence the impact on life is significant. The rising cost of food and medical supplies are so high that they will have to face a major setback of cutting down expense.

The government policy of cutting down interest rates has nothing to push the Indian GDP to a significant kick start. Who will borrow and why he will borrow when demand is less. Why should I borrow when my job is at stake? These questions will chase and the journey of low earning from savings has kick-started now.

Now I ask this question to all of you about what should be done by that senior Citizen?

Any advice?",Non-Political,False,0.8,"[""Don't forget to revise older topics regularly. Individual topics aren't very tough but being in touch with all topics at the end of two years require regular effort."", ""Didn't give JEE but scored decently in Maharashtra CET. After having close to 3 years work experience I can say that the most important skill you would need is to learn the art of explaining.\n\nSo whatever you study, try teaching it to someone else. Could be your friend, someone at home or yourself. This way you'll come to know how much you have understood and parallely you will develop the art of explaining which will ultimately help you later in your career."", ""Three things:\n\n1. **Fundamentals**: I know it sounds clichéd when you hear people talk about it, but this is the very important. By fundamentals, I mean you should know why you took an approach while solving the problem when you solve a problem. Mere rote learning of methods/formulae won't help much. This is where all your derivations, proofs, etc in the course material come in useful. While that will never be directly asked in exams, they will build your fundamentals. In short, whenever solving a problem, just think why you're choosing the method you're choosing.\n2. **Practice**: Do not just practice by the count of questions you are practising, but make it a mix of objective, subjective, and other formats of questions. This ensures that you learn to solve the problems using first principles (by solving subjective questions), while learning the tricks of the game at the same time (by solving questions of other formats). DO NOT SKIP subjective questions because they build your fundamentals (also you never know when JEE may ask such questions, they've done it in past). Whenever you are solving a bunch of questions, put a timer on according to the average time you'll be spending on each question in exam, and solve it like you're giving a mini test. While practising, always ensure that you put on a timer. This builds the exam mindset. Be honest with yourself. For the questions which go wrong or you could not solve, you can refer notes at the end of your practice session. Additionally also analyse your solutions to the ones which you did correct, because at times it might be an incorrect logic but correct answer. For all the questions you solve, especially for objective questions, ensure that you solve it in fair (keep dedicated notebooks for solving questions) and not just mark answers by doing rough work. This will help in long term when you want to revise/refer back after few months. A good handwriting might seem like taking extra time, but if you do that regularly, you'll realise it is not the case and it actually makes you systemise your thoughts, thereby reducing the clutter in your head when you sit for the actual exam. \n3. **Discipline**: I can not stress on this enough. JEE is a tough exam, one of the few ones which you can't do by studying at the end moment. Consistency is very important and while you should enjoy life during preparation, you should avoid wasting time unnecessarily. Get off social media and other online avenues if you can for a couple of years. There is a lot of time for those once you reach IIT. JEE is still conducted the old way of studying a set of topics and solving questions from them. Keeping off the internet will a) save time, and b) prevent you from getting into unnecessary conversations not at all useful for your preparation. There is a lot of preparation to be done currently, and slacking is only going to make it tough. \n\nOther consideration: While joining a coaching institute is ensures that above points are covered, ensure that you are getting time for self-study after coaching, since you'll also be in school during these two years. One way to save time is to enrol in a school which does not require you to attend regularly (happens in Kota, I do not know which city you're from). Open schooling is one way to legitimately not attend schools and just go for exams. This will save a lot of your time, because you need to do self-study no matter which coaching you're enrolled in. Also, if you're joining a coaching institute, take it seriously. A lot of aspirants tend to digress from the path few months into the preparation because of one reason or the other. Remember, this is not entertainment, you're getting into serious preparation and things might not always be according to your comfort. \n\nIt's a tough exam, selection ratio is very less, but do remember you only need one seat. People have been getting selected since so many years by just following the basics. \n\nCheers!""]",False,False,False,False,False,True

Is Polygamy allowed in Hinduism?,3.0,fu50q9,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu50q9/is_polygamy_allowed_in_hinduism/,16.0,"As all of you do know, according to the Hindu Marriage Act, it is illegal for Hindus to have more than one spouse at a time. 
However, this was a little confusing for me as I know that in ancient times, multiple marriages were prominent. 

Hence I went online and researched about this. I found in the Anusasana Parva, Book 13 of Mahabharata some insight on this. 

SECTION XLIV (44)


A Brahmana can take three wives. A Kshatriya can take two wives. As regards the Vaisya, he should take a wife from only his own order. The children born of these wives should all be regarded as equal. 2 Of the three wives of a Brahmana, she taken from his own order should be regarded as the foremost. Similarly, of the two wives permitted to the Kshatriya, she taken from his own order should be regarded as superior. Some say that persons belonging to the three higher orders mayntake, only for purposes of enjoyment (and not for those of virtue), wives from the lowest or the Sudra order. Others, however, forbid the practice.

A Brahmana, by begetting children upon a Sudra woman, incurs the liability of performing an expiation. A person of thirty years of age should wed a girl of ten years of age called a Nagnika. 1 Or, a person of one and twenty years of age should wed a girl of seven years of age. That girl who has no brother nor father should not be wed, O chief of Bharata's race, for she may be intended as Putrika of her sire.



I researched this on many forums and people seem to say regularly that nowhere in Hinduism is this neither discouraged or encouraged. However if that is the case, why do so many Hindu people scoff at the sound of multiple marriages? Also how did the Hindu Marriage Act come into for then?

I also found it strange how it says 30 year old men can marry girls of the age of 10...


If you are just going to be defensive and angry at me for pointing this out, don't bother to comment. My family is Hindu too and I'm just curious and would like to learn more about this.

------

As tens of lakhs of Indians tuned in to their news channels/Twitter today at 9 am, we heard the leader of our nation ask us to light candles at 9 pm on Sunday.

In a time where medical professionals are being attacked by patients & their kin, where medical professionals are quite vocally expressing their need for PPEs, where people are clearly still flouting outside, the leader called this a successful operation & that the next step is to light a candle?

In a time where we see cases of migrants who passed away while walking hundreds of kilometers home, where in a city like Mumbai, there is still no proper arrangement to deliver essentials to residents, the leader wants us to stand tall at 9 pm.

And shortly after the speech, the IT cell went into overdrive & within a few minutes we recieved WhatsApp forwards stating how this 9 pm candle light will rid India of COVID-19. And there is no effort or modicum of effort from the authorities to dispel these fake forwards.

I am genuinely scared that people will take this as an opportunity to come out & do bonfires/candlelight marches, and what not.

Credit where it is due, the lockdown was needed. But, so was the planning. In a time where the world's eyes are upon India and Bloomberg put out an article that shows that India failed it's citizens, the world scrutiny is even more.

Should the leader have addressed points like:

- increasing testing (especially in areas like the Dharavi slums of Mumbai that can become a cluster in no time)?

- PPEs for medical professionals?

- urging people to keep medical professionals in regard & to respect them?

- held a call with top Virologists & Doctors instead of top 40 cricketers?

The WHO envoy might praise India & I seriously doubt if WHO's words hold any weight after their disastrous handling of the situation, but I can feel that the world is judging us and laughing at us.

Do not get too invested in any of these to the point that you suspend disbelief and let it consume your identity. You are more than just one thought or ideology. 

Your unconditional support to these makes you nothing more than a loyal servant. A useful idiot.

I know those words are harsh but there is no softer way of saying it.

By unconditionally supporting your dear leader, the favorite actor or the ideology that you believe in you let it consume your complex character and become this monotonous set of programmed reaction. 

You become part of the herd that follows its Shepard off the cliff. The rats that follow the piper down to death.

Did you know that you can show your support while at the same time critically looking at things based on their merits?

If you cannot invest your critical thinking, then at least don’t dismiss who took the effort of doing so just because it goes against your herd. Doing so might feel like a victory in the short run but it will set you up for failure since you are not receptive to feedback. After all how strong is your belief in those things when it can’t even stand the test of opposing arguments and ridicule? How robust is an argument which cannot stand cross examination? If you want your ideology or your fandom to sustain then learn from those systems and institutions which did sustain for years. They are all open to criticism and evolve consistently based on  feedback.

I know it must be very comforting and happy when you feel part of a tribe however distant and imaginary your role in it is. 
But there are also the negative aspects such as the ego death and identity collapse when these ideologies eventually fail the test of reason and argument. 

So be brave to stand apart in the crowd. Don’t let your stage fright get you.

Be smart in where you invest your support. Don’t let the piper sing you down the cliff.

Be safe and protect yourself from accidentally giving too much of yourself for something or someone without being open to criticism. 

It will only lead to ridicule, shame and regret.

P.S. - This is just a PSA based on my personal experience. Obviously this doesn’t apply to every kind of loyal supporter but, mostly to those who conflate their identities so much that it leads to mental and physical harm to themselves and others.

Suggestions for a Bakwaas College.,0.0,fu30l0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu30l0/suggestions_for_a_bakwaas_college/,8.0," 

Hi guys. This period of lockdown has been a time, where I reconnected with many of my old friends. One such friend I got in touch with, yesterday, confided in me, and I assured him, I'll help him to the best of my ability.

Both of us studied, undergraduation together(2014-2017) and could vibe very well, as we were misfits in an ultraconservative college. From, my past posts, it'd be evident that, I studied in a tier-3 college. I always, wondered, why did he opt to study in that shithole after a schooling, from the best CBSE school in the state. Later, I learnt that his father had insisted, he study there, and he didn't want to let down his father.

In 2017, that's when demonetisation occured, his father turned from the richest realty brokers in the town to a person with lot of debts. Hence, he took over the business, steered the family and now is in a financially stable situation again.

To give a perspective how mentally fucked up our NAAC A graded college was:

Incident 1) I've a best friend, Elizabeth, she introduced me to her roommate Rose. Now, the fucked up part is, Elizabeth figures there is something intimate between us two, she goes to the extent of calling Rose's parents and coming to my house to talk about it ( We knew she wouldn't jepordise it, but it was a word of caution). She is fine with the relationship if it was serious, if I'm ready to marry Rose, but Elizabeth went bonkers when she realized I was casual about rose and rose was implicitly casual about me.

Incident 2) In our batch. there was not a single women who put up their faces in social media, it was either a flower, baby or some other random crap. When I asked them, why ? They said they fear their pictures being morphed and their marriage (arrange) prospects being destroyed. Dafuq, I was flabbergasted.

Incident 3) There are women only in few unaided courses. If I ask a person, to introduce me to a women, it is considered a sacrilege. These retards, don't understand what is socialising and getting introduced to a new group of people are, they don't have any social pleasantaries wired in them. Similarly, if you break the ice with women you end up being labelled 'Kozhi'. An informal word for a guy on prowl for women, a fucboi.

Incident 4) Another guy, comes regularly drunk to class, however he poses no problem to the professors or . This another girl, lets say Maria, has warned him a zen times don't come in drunk. One fine day, she actually goes and ditches to the professor and huge drama ensues.

I hope the above are enough to put to light, regarding the level of mental maturity these kids posses. They live in a cocoon. These kids, though they are in college, they have the mentality that they are in primary school. It's nothing he has been used to.

He said, he was fed up of living for his family, he wants to enjoy 'college life'. He said, he is not worried about his academic credentials, because, at the end of the day, he is expected to take over his family business. However, his only criterion being, the institution should have an above average reputation Eg SJC Science and Arts, SJCC, MCC, Amity, Symbiosis etc such that his arranged marriage prospects don't get hindered due to his place of education. He is willing to relocate to any part of India, as long as he gets to party, go on road trips, host house parties, attend NH7 weekender, sunburn, play party games ( never have I ever, cards against humanity etc. ). You get the picture.

Now, this guy has money,though he is not as loaded as predemonetisation, he is what you call rich. What are few places that you'd suggest for him, he has got money and time on his hand. Would you suggest some options across India?",AskIndia,False,0.42,"['""asking for a friend ...""', ""Dude. I go to a similar college with such idiots. \n\nI'm considered an outcast there.

At this point, all the major countries are facing facing a huge pandemic. Though our Embassy here in the USA is working it's best for us.

PSA: Don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cards,120.0,ftybqp,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftybqp/psa_dont_opt_for_the_3month_moratorium_unless_you/,23.0,"I see a lot of misinformation floating around about the RBI moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, I guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
When you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      

Credit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",Business/Finance,False,0.97,"['This its another master stroke by RBI to pull in funds', ""I'm doing the exact opposite - getting some money from savings and quickly closing my credit card bills asap.

I will start with my downfalls first.

I am from VTU and I have a bad undergrad percentage. I have 48% with 9 backlogs and took 5 years to graduate. Got two backlogs in my first semester because my faculties gave me 0 in the internals. Then I took it as a challenge and from my second semester I was in top 10 of my class. Come fifth semester, I got 3 backlogs out of 6 subjects. I had given my best. The university failed students on purpose and they used to make money from the revaluation money. I am not even kidding, it was all over the news. They used to evaluate only 10% of the papers applied for revaluation and rest of us used to get backlogs. This broke my confidence and I completely neglected my studies and concentrated more on gaining bulk of my knowledge from real world scenarios.

What I did from 5th semester?

My team and I won the zonal level robotics competition organised by IITs and advanced to the National level Robotics Championship at IIT Madras.

Started my own startup. We used to be like the event management company for technical seminars. We went to different colleges and organise technical seminars and workshops. We would get someone from the industry for the workshops. We functioned from 2015-2017. 

When all my friends graduated in 2017, I still had backlogs. I sat at home and relearned everything. Completed Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses in 6 months. I got a full time job offer as a Machine Learning Engineer at an AI consultancy startup from my programming and analytical skills. I wasn't even graduated then. I still had backlogs. They were kind enough to offer me a job based on my skills. I worked there for 2 years on many facets of ML. 

I recently looked at MS DS curriculum from top universities in US and I can boldly claim I know more than the curriculum they  offer.

Reason for my MS -  To get research experience and explore the opportunities at US market and also wash away my undergrad filth.

The following are my questions/concerns - 

1. How to justify my undergrad bad percentage in my SoP? Is it beyond justification? 
2. Should I be ambitious and apply for top universities or would it be wise, considering my undergrad score, to apply for lower ranked universities and get the research experience?

Other companies are also announcing price increases, but since Apple products are priced higher (and most models are imported), the difference in Apple phones is harder on pocket when compared to other Chinese brands.

This will unfortunately tank the sales of iPhone in India, especially now after recession. Upcoming iPhone SE price will also be more expensive than expected.

---

**Current Taxes Applicable :**

1. Locally assembled phones (7, 7 Plus, XR) : 18% GST
2. Imported phones (11, 11 Pro) : 28% Import Duty + 18% GST = 46% Tax

Also something to note that this hike hasn't factored in falling rupee against dollar yet. Rupee was around 70/dollar last year when iPhone 11 were launched (Old Price in the list below) and is currently at 76/dollar, so expect this to cause a further increase in price and subsequent taxes applied on the converted rupee price.

I was planning to buy the iPhone 9 Plus to replace the XR that I donated to my mom, but guess I'll just get a PocoFone in the meanwhile and save up for iPhone 12. Well.. fuck.

I won't even go into the ""start molesting the girl and she'll like you"" romance subplot - I've seen fucking Hentai's that have better character relationships.

Honestly, the frustrating thing is that India is capable of releasing great cinema.  Company by RGV is my favorite Indian movie.  Black Friday, Satya, Ab Tak Chappan, Taare Zameen Par, Delhi Belly, Kahaani are all excellent.  There are plenty others which are at the very least competent - Sarkar 1/2, Sarfarosh, etc...

But this Baahubali shit... man..I'm dead serious when I say if the Indian public thinks that this is fine film-making - we deserve to be wiped out of existence.  It isn't a poverty thing either - I was at a theatre in the US - and plenty of absolute retards were clapping and whooping at the shitty dialogue and the ""romance"".  

I grew up in India watching plenty of cheesy 80s/90s Hindi movies - and enjoyed many as a kid, and plenty as an adult.  But Baahubali was so far above and beyond in sheer stupidity that I weep for our civilization.  This movie is going to be held up as a ""shining"" example of Indian cinema...

Foreigner Impression: My Favorite Thing About India,17.0,53vioc,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/53vioc/foreigner_impression_my_favorite_thing_about_india/,183.0,"I recently wrapped up a trip to India (I did the Golden Triangle). My favorite thing about my trip to India was how much it made me appreciate that I don't live in India. 

Before arriving in Delhi I did research and booked a two-night hotel stay ahead of time. Upon arrival I went to an 'official' taxi stand at the Delhi airport to get a ride to the hotel. It was 02:00 and my traveling partner and I were both exhausted from the flight. The taxi driver began driving us to our hotel and then gave us a story about how the roads were closed due to political violence. He told us that unfortunately he wouldn't be able to bring us to our hotel due to the road closures. He then brought us to a 'tourism agency' and a desk agent proceeded to make fake phone calls to his friend who pretended to be working at my real hotel. The desk agent told me they would have to make alternative sleeping arrangements for us for our own safety. After making me feel bad and then demanding payment for making him wait (what a nice guy, right?), my taxi driver brought us to a very seedy hotel. The front desk agents at the hotel refused to give us wifi access lest we figure out that we had been abducted/kidnapped. Unfortunately, I was too tired and unaware of my surroundings to challenge or question the scam. Looking back I realize that we were essentially abducted. The next day my hotel emailed me and asked why we never showed up. When I emailed them back to explain what happened they weren't even surprised. This was just the first day.

The rest of my trip was a relentless series of scams and harassments. I never got scammed again thanks to the wonderful education I received on the first night. But I have to say, it was exhausting and made it difficult to simply walk around. Small packs of Indian teen males dressed like homoerotic cowboys droned around treating me like I was fucking Justin Bieber. Many of them asking me for selfies and then taking pictures of me anyway when I declined their request.

Then we took a train to Agra. I had become intimate with the filth, dirt and pollution in Delhi up to this point. The massive piles of trash, dirt and feces; ungodly smells that have permanently permeated my subconscience. I spent the next few hours on the train watching no less than a thousand of people taking shits on the train tracks. The train-shitting will be permanently etched into my memory for all of time.

Around this time I came down with travelers diarrhea. Most likely from some shit that I ate because of improper food handling. Or maybe I got it from the shit I drank because the water in India is all contaminated. Regardless of how I got it, I spent the next 5 days shackled to my hotel room because I couldn't stop explosively shitting out diarrhea. 

Finally I began to feel better and decided to go see the Taj Mahal. After dodging scam attempts, getting harassed and heckled I eventually made it. After taking some videos of the Taj Mahal with my camera I soon found myself surrounded by a pack of men, including an Army officer with a machine gun. They then berated me for taking pictures and videos of the Taj while hundreds of other people around us took pictures and videos with their cameras and phones. I asked the men and the army officer why hundreds of other people were allowed to film. The answer to this question will probably accompany me to my grave. I was then harassed by these same men who wouldn't leave me alone until I checked my camera into a locker. 

It was at this point that I decided that I would be engaging in masochism if I continued my trip. So I left.

My takeaways:
+ The filth, dirt, garbage, feces and smell are such a massive problem that they can't be ignored. Egypt, Palestine and Jordan seemed like a swiss mountain retreat compared to the stuff I saw in India. + The scamming, harassing and heckling was non-stop and exhausting. + I have never seen such a wanton disregard/outright hostility of people toward their own environment. + The expression: ""Don't shit where you eat"" never resonated with me more than when I was walking around India. + It amazed me that India is on the same planet as the other countries around the world that I've visited.

In short: thank you India for giving me perspective and appreciation for the things I have in my life. For the loving people who don't judge me or tell me who I can/cannot marry. For the people who don't judge me for not believing in God. For the faucet that gives me clean drinking water and the food that nourishes my body. Thank you India, for reminding me that I live in a place where people even have the luxury to care about the planet we all share together. For all of you struggling to make a better India, I send you my love and wish you the best of luck in the struggle. For those of you who continue the status quo without any consideration or thought: may god have mercy on your soul.

Dear Friends, 

This is a very important message if you care about the unity, peace and progress of India. 

In the last few weeks, we've seen that media, especially the English Language channels and newspapers are continuously harping about things like 'rising intolerance' and making a big issue out of some isolated incidents which happened in UP and Karnataka. If you are foreign investor looking to set up some industry in India, you would certainly get scared looking at the evening English news shows (NDTV, India Today etc) and morning English newspapers  (Indian Express, ToI etc).


But on the ground, we the common people of the country don't see any such intolerance or hate crimes happening.  We see that people of all castes, creeds and religions are going about their normal lives without any obstruction from anybody. Since Modi government got elected, no changes have been made to any laws related to social matters. Then why is the media 'manufacturing' these stories of so called intolerance? Why is the media laying the blame at Modi's doorsteps for crimes that are taking place in states ruled by 'secular' parties like Cong (Kar) and SP (UP) ? Why would channels and papers like NDTV, India Today , ToI, IE etc cause damage to the image of India just for benefitting anti-Modi parties like Cong,CPI(M) etc? Here's why :


Pronoy Roy (head of NDTV) is married to Radhika Roy. Radhika Roy is the sister of Brinda Karat of CPI(M). Brinda Karat is the wife of Prakash Karat , ex-head of CPI(M)


Barkha Dutt of NDTV is currently married to Haseeb Ahmed Drabu, who is a PDP politician from J&K


Nidhi Razdan of NDTV is live-in partner of Omar Abdullah, former CM of J&K


Sonia Singh of NDTV is married to RPN Singh of Cong and a former minister in UPA govt


Rajdeep Sardesai of India Today (formerly CNN-IBN and NDTV before that) is married to Sagarika Ghose who is currently with ToI and ET Now (formerly CNN-IBN). Sagarika Ghose is the daughter of Bhaskar Ghose, who was appointed as Director General of Doordarshan by Cong govt. Bhaskar Ghose has been accused of doing financial favours to NDTV, his son in law's employer.


Vishnu Som of NDTV is the son of Himachal Som. Himachal Som was then made Indian ambassador to 'Italy' by Cong govt. Reba Som is the mother of Vishnu Som. She is an 'eminent intellectual'. She has written books about Nehru and Congress.


Vikram Chandra is an anchor and the CEO of NDTV. He has been accused of money laundering to the tune of 5500 Cr for P Chidambaram from the 2G scam loot (link here : http://www.manushi.in/articles.php?articleId=1749#.VjHTuH4rLIU  )


Sitaram Yechuri is the current head of CPI(M). He is married to Seema Chishti. Seema Chishti is the resident editor of Indian Express , Delhi.


Sanjay Jha is the spokesperson of Cong and a frequent face on TV. Rajkamal Jha is his cousin. Rajkamal is the Managing Editor of Indian Express.


I hope now you realise why English language media paints Modi/BJP/RSS as a monster.  I would encourage you to google and verify the correctness of each of these facts. Forward this message to every Indian so that the real evil face of media is exposed. Our media is wolf in sheep's clothes.

A Bengali woman's guide for Bengali girls on how to choose men.,3.0,56x8y9,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56x8y9/a_bengali_womans_guide_for_bengali_girls_on_how/,75.0,"Let me try to answer this question in a slightly longish way. First a little bit about myself. I am a Bengali woman based out of Mumbai and am a mother of 2 lovely kids. My husband too is a Bengali. What I will detail below are what I’ve heard and gathered over the years from my Bengali girl friends, colleagues, relatives and acquaintances over the course of many years.

First a few points about marriage itself. One, marriage isn’t just about two individuals finding heart to heart connect. Humans are social animals and its said that no individual is an island. So deciding to marry any person isn’t just about the person and you, it’s also about your family and his family (at the very least) and also about the wider society itself. Taking the view that marriage is only about two individuals is selfish and such marriages die a natural death, with deleterious consequences to both parties, in the course of time.

Allow me first to digress a bit and try and answer as to what makes Bengali women so wanted and desirable. First, they are truly equal to males what with their parents never having discriminated against them in their upbringing on the basis of their gender. Second, they are well qualified and with their smarts, poise and confidence get well earning jobs. Third, they are considered “hot” and therefore desirable by other Indian men. Fourth, they are trusting and liberal, which is often taken advantage off, and last but not the least, they are money foolish. It is a proverb that a fool and his money are soon separated and Bengalis fit this description to a T. When Bengali women fall for cheats such as below its but natural that their dumbed down money instincts, coupled with their liberalism, can be a poisonous concoction that leads to financial ruin. Look no further than what has allegedly been done to Bengali women just on the fake promise of marriage. 'Tax man' duped women of Rs70 lakh on matrimonial sites - Times of India. If Bengalis can lose money merely on the promise of marriage it doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes do infer that the Bengali and her money will soon be parted in a closer relationship, such as marriage, if she isn’t careful.

**How do Bengali non-Bengali marriages impact Bengali families economically?**

It is often seen that Bengali girls, despite being given a liberal upbringing and good education, choose to marry partners from downright misogynistic and patriarchal cultures. These are the people with the problems of female foeticide in their societies. When a Bengali girl marries a non-Bengali, the entire past, present and future life of the Bengalis are impacted. Bengali society by spending money on the education of their daughters and thereby creating an economically independent entity are in a way subsidizing non-Bengali societies, who in a economic sense “profited” by commiting female foeticide. Secondly in the present, the entire resources generated by the Bengali girl and her savings are appropriated and used by the non-Bengali society. Thirdly, after the death of her parents, it is seen that the Bengali girl invariably litigates for paternal property. Note that Punjabis and Banias, who have a strong Delhi connection have better access to lawyers who can get justice at the Supreme Court. As an example, gentle reader, you are referred to the following Supreme Court judgment (Civil Appeal No 4646 of 2006)

(edit : link removed; just search in google for Civil Appeal No 4646 of 2006)

So in a way the Bengali father is working his entire life for the betterment of non-Bengali society.


**Dowry**

A point that is often missed is that love marriage is not a dowry free marriage. The dowry system in non-Bengali cultures is systemic and deeply entrenched in different aspects of their cultures. Bengalis often think that since there is no upfront demand of money the marriage is dowry free. However that is not so. In the long run the Bengali father will end up giving more dowry over the lifetime of his daughter’s marriage. In addition after his death his son will be expected to take over and continue giving the dowry. How does this system work. Non-Bengali cultures ask for expensive gifts like gold, diamonds, even cash, clothes (for all relatives) for various ceremonies after marriage. Thus there will be ceremonies after say 30 days of marriage, 45 days of marriage, 6 months of marriage, 1 year of marriage, which have no equivalent in Bengali culture in which the girl’s father is expected to give gifts. Often times these are done on the pretext of pujas. In addition marriage ceremonies are often elaborate and the non-Bengali side often demands that Bengali families pony up money for that. This can be upto 4–5 lakhs conservatively. In addition since non-Bengalis usually have lots of relatives then it’s expected that gifts be given to a large number of relatives, maybe upto 50 people. One can easily calculate expenditure for that. On atleast two specific occasions, i.e. baby showers and right after birth of children, the girls parents are expected to send gifts and money to the non-Bengali inlaws and relatives. Expenditure for the baby shower is atleast 1 to 1 and half lakhs and after birth of each child it is expected that Bengali parents will send gifts to inlaws, son-in-law and baby, the expenditure for which is not less than 2–3 lakhs for each child. In addition non-Bengali families expect gifts on the occasions of festivals such as Diwali etc. If the Bengali father refuses then obviously the working Bengali girl will pay these from her savings. This is dowry plain and simple. Similarly non-Bengalis give gifts to their sisters on these occasions and the Bengali girls often times spend their and their Bengali parents’ life savings on the marriage ceremonies of their husband’s sisters. This too is dowry as money is being extorted from Bengalis on the relationship formed through marriage. The Indian courts accept all of the above examples as valid instances of dowry harassment.

**Diet**

One point that is not given enough importance in Bengali girl non-Bengali men marriages is the issue of diet. I advise gentle readers to read the following National Geographic article on diet and how the diet of our ancestors is key to our sustained health and wellness.

The Evolution of Diet

If Bengali girl is put in a situation where she can’t eat fish and meat then it will impact her health. How one may ask? See meat/fish is harder to digest so it stays in the system longer and makes people feel fuller longer. Therefore people don’t binge eat processed foods like chips, biscuits etc thereby keeping weight in control. It is often seen that Bengali girls moving to a vegetarian diet after marriage put on weight as they have to eat more to feel full. This gives rise to various health problems such as hypertension, diabetes and even cancer. So the best food for an ethnic Bengali is the diet of her ancestors, that is maach, bhaat, pulses and gourds.

Ok, getting back to the main question at hand. I will classify non-Bengali men based on their backgrounds and try and provide guidance on the the question asked.

***North Indian Men, mainly from UP, Bihar, MP (mainly Hindi speakers)***

These people are parochial and don’t have much love for either Bengalis or Bengali culture. In fact due to linguistic pride they positively feel superior to Bengalis and seek to put them down. These are also the folks with dowry/dowry death/domestic violence problems in their own community. See the case of north Indian political leader of anti-corruption party based out of Delhi married to Bengali wife.

I might also add here almost everyone in this category has a relative or two in politics. Now, dear Bengali lass, you may see this as an advantage. However think about the following. Social interactions demand give and take. I know of a Bengali lady MBA, from a premier institute in India, who married her classmate who belongs to this category of people. Both husband and wife are in corporate jobs. However the non-Bengali man has politicians as relatives and they have pressured the couple to be their benami for illegally acquired wealth. This is because at the husband’s family level it was felt that this couple was best placed to hide/invest their wealth as they could explain that it was theirs. However this didn’t fly with the income tax department and last checked there were prosecutions against the couple for wealth beyond their means. Also note that most politics in India, at all levels, is accompanied by court cases etc. I know of Bengali lady, a software engineer working in a well known Indian company, who was forced to stand surety in court for a relative of her non-Bengali husband of this category. This person then absconded from court proceedings and the poor Bengali girl had to face the ignominy of being jailed for few days for having stood false surety.

**North India Hindu Punjabis/North India Banias/Gujrati Patels/Jains/Marwaris**

This is a category different from the one above. They don’t display any overt hatred towards Bengalis or Bengali people but they are very money minded. Since they don’t display any overt hatred Bengali girls are often drawn towards these people. However the reasons why these people want to approach Bengali girls is not always love and altruism. Recall that Bengalis are well educated with good jobs. A good many of the above category of boys have startup dreams nowadays and expect their wives (and their wives parents) to seed fund their ideas and for the Bengali wife to earn while they take risks. That only 1 out of 7 start ups succeed is a cold statistic that is true in India as it is true in the rest of the world. Bengalis being liberal minded, especially Bengali parents with only one daughter may be more likely to pony up money for the non Bengali son-in-law’s startup dreams. The point here is that if a Bengali father has a net worth of 1 crore he may be convinced to give upto 50 lakhs for his non Bengali son-in-law’s startup dreams. Were the same non Bengali son-in-law married inside his community, his caste father-in-law would only have given him 25 lakhs (out of his networth of 10 crores). As stated earlier Bengalis are fools with respect to money and girls should see if there are any warning signs that they will ever be exploited.

I might also point out that today a substantial number of Bengali girls get married to the boys of this category. So large is the trend that were these boys Muslims, the Hindutvadis would have labeled it as love jihad. However Bengalis don’t think in this way.

Lastly, there is the important point of diet. A vast majority of these folks are vegetarian.

The other major point is that in these families the finances of the family members is often controlled by an elder male, usually the father-in-law or even the father-in-law’s elder brother. Everybody is expected to turn over the finances to the control of this gentleman. The sons do so and their wives, irrespective of background are also expected to do the same.

One special point I’ve noticed amongst this set is that Bengali girls with business qualifications such as MBA, CA, CS, ACMA, Actuary are in high demand and affairs with non-Bengali men start during the course of professional study itself.

**Special point**

One thing that is seen with most north Indian men is that they project more that what they are, be it in terms of wealth, accomplishment, family status and most importantly earning capacity. They may have some business/companies also but their earnings will be minimal and they are actually looking to live off the earnings of the wife. Most Bengalis are from service class and take things at face value and get fooled. See the case of north Indian political leader of anti-corruption party based out of Delhi married to Bengali wife.

One another point is the celebration of Holi in North Indian families. Usually the ladies stay in the house and the relatives come to celebrate at home. This is a festival wherein touching and hugging may be to the extent that the non-North Indian wife may feel uncomfortable especially if the male persons doing so belong to a different generation.

A third point is that people of this category often engage in side businesses to supplement their income. They expect their wives also to engage and be part of this business. This could be anything like Amway, selling insurance, stocks, mutual funds, or even home made crafts, drawings, soaps etc. Bengali women who often have some training in arts and crafts, which their Bengali families trained them in as a hobby, may be particularly vulnerable and under pressure at non Bengali households to commercialize their knowledge. So Bengali woman will be expected to earn in office, do their full quota of housework and child rearing and also engage in side business of selling Amway or crafts. It is not that the incomes from these are fabulous. Yes, everyone desires extra money and income. However Bengalis have solved the problem differently by working hard to get good education so that they can get better paying jobs and not have to do this side income business.

**Muslim boys, both Bengali and non-Bengali.**

A certain set (not all) of these types actually consider it their bounden duty to convert Kafir girls to Islam. That’s their only objective. Be wary of this type. Typically their misogyny will give them away.

**Tam Brahms (also most other South Indian Brahmins)**

This set is most akin to Bengalis, in terms of love for culture, literature, music etc. barring diet. However be prepared to bear with an overbearing attitude and a “I-m-so-superior” attitude and a “preferred” way to do things. If you can tolerate this then go ahead. In addition these people, and in fact most non-Bengali men, are far more money minded then Bengali men.

**Non Brahmin South Indians**

There’s nothing in particular to not recommend them. However a lot of these people are quite flexible with their faith. At the time of marriage the boy may be Hindu but after some time he may convert to Christianity. Also most of these people have one branch of their family which is Christian. I know of a Bengali lady lecturer who married a Telugu gentleman. At the time of marriage the gentleman was Hindu. About 10 years ago the gentleman converted to Christianity and became a Christian preacher. His Bengali wife also became a Christian and co preacher and they now have their own ministry in Andhra.

**Keralite men**

With a heavy dose of communism, these people may share some of the liberal ideals of the Bengali. However be warned about chettan’s love for beef parotta and liquor and that he and his Malayali male friends will love to gather for binge drinking sessions. A last point about South Indian men, and it applies across caste and religion, is that they are thrifty spenders and the Bengali’s innate liberalism may be appalled at the penny pinching ways of these people.

**Marathi men**

I stay in Mumbai and have been to my fair share of Marathi boy, Bengali girl marriages. In 100% percent of the cases I’ve noticed that the marriage was conducted only as per Marathi culture. While in marriages with other non-Bengalis a few or even the entire marriage happens as per Bengali customs, in Marathi-Bengali marriages the marriage is always as per Marathi culture. Marathis don’t really have any strong opinions about Bengalis but are vigilant about their culture at their times.

**Foreigners/White men.**

White men, may not be able to differentiate between Bengali women and non-Bengali women but there are often some wrong reasons as to why foreign men look for Indian women. Chief among them is that they want to marry somebody to whom they can always feel superior. This is an inbuilt and unconscious racism in their psyche. The Bengali or Indian wife is essentially a maid, albeit a well treated one.



Since the writing of this answer I’ve been asked if there are other observations that I’d like to share on Bengali non-Bengali marriages.

So in no particular order of things here are some of my observations.

About 50% of the Bengali girls who come from WB or north eastern states to metros such as Delhi-NCR/Mumbai/Bangalore marry non Bengalis. About 10% of Bengali boys too do so.
99.99% of Bengali women whose fathers migrated to the above mentioned metros and who have had a substantial period of stay outside WB marry non-Bengalis. About 25% of Bengali men also do so.
In the past 5 years or so about 25% to 35% of Bengali girls in WB too are married to non-Bengali men.
In the first year after marriage Bengali girls married to non-Bengalis will invariably turn up at the local Durga Puja pandal, non-Bengali hubby in tow for sindur khela. This decreases as time passes and later it’s all about Karwa Chauth and Diwali and Durga Puja is given a pass.

Bengali girls marrying Bengalis, irrespective of place of origin, are generally past 30 years of age. The men are usually 35+. Both sides may have had a broken affair or two. The Bengali women is more likely to have had an affair with a non-Bengali man.

Bengali girls marrying non-Bengalis, irrespective of place of origin, are in the age group of 21–27, i.e. their prime age. In almost all cases in this category the Bengali lady has a baby within 1 to 1 and a half year of marriage.
Bengali ladies adjust or rather compromise far more in marriages with non-Bengalis than they do in marriages with Bengali males, to the point of submission. Often times this results in substantial loss of independence, especially with respect to food habits and finance. This no wonder is a cause of delight to her non-Bengali in-laws who extol her virtues as the ideal daughter-in-law. One doesn’t know the reason for this behaviour. Perhaps there’s a guilty complex that since they took the decision on their own they must bear the cross of their decision owing to their high levels of conscientiousness.

Bengali girls, ostensibly feminist, take their freedom and liberalism to be license to choose a non Bengali husband where they have LESS freedom post marriage. It is often seen that the marriage turns abusive and the Bengali girl and her parents are left holding the bab(ies) quite liberally.

It is also seen that often when Bengalis marry their daughters to non-Bengalis they forget all principles and gift expensive items such as cars to the non-Bengali son-in-law, something that no Bengali son-in-law or Bengali family would even have demanded.


Some people wrote in to say that. but Ma’am, my non-Bengali guy is awesome and has all the qualities that I’m looking for. He’s rich, well educated, handsome, funny, caring and has great earning potential. So what if he’s non-Bengali? Also all of what you describe is in general and my guy doesn’t quite seem to fit your description. To those here’s my counter argument. Consider that you’re buying a flat or a house. You find this fabulous property, at the right price, at the right location. The construction also seems OK to you and the builder is promising to deliver your project on time. So you go on the internet and find that lo and behold this builder’s earlier projects are all mired in controversy. In one place he’s delivered behind schedule and in another his walls have seepage. So promptly you drop your plans of buying the flat at the builder’s current project, even though in the present case the builder has every intention of performing good construction and delivering the project on time. So you can draw parallels to your marriage from this example.

**Conclusion**

People often ask as to why Bengali girls want to marry non-Bengalis. If I were to hazard a guess it would be one, low self-esteem and two, they don’t like their fathers’ personalities. The Bengali gentleman is too mild-mannered for his own good and women and daughters need a good father figure. If the father were stricter then they would have had more caste pride. In addition Bengali fathers don’t stand up to their wives and are not assertive with them which is why daughters don’t consider them to be “strong”.

Nevertheless, gentle Bengali lass, if even after reading this you insist on marrying a non-Bengali man insist on two things.

The marriage ceremony will be entirely by the Bengali method. i.e you will marry in a saree and not a lehenga or something and groom will wear a dhuti and topor provided as per custom by your family.
You will never, repeat never, keep fasts for misogynistic and patriarchal festivals like “Karwa Chauth”. Say that your best wishes are always with your husband and even if you didn’t keep a fast he would do well and have a long life.
Don’t have a baby before 3 years of marriage. If the yellow matter hits the roof then you can make a less painful exit.

Insist on cooking and eating non-vegetarian food at home, even if your non-Bengali husband doesn’t eat it. This is good for your health and if your husband and his family care for your health they will not oppose it.
Before you get married to non-Bengali family think whether your daughter will be given the same opportunities, education, environment and freedom to choose, especially her life partner, as you have been given in your Bengali household.

Ensure that you get married in the place where your parents live or in your home town in West Bengal. This is particularly important if god forbidding you are tomorrow forced to litigate with your husband’s family to enforce your rights. It is often seen that non-Bengali families getting married to Bengalis arrange for marriages at their hometowns in remote parts of North India. Think of this. If you ever need to litigate then it will be very difficult to enforce your rights from that remote town. Heck, you may not be able to even engage a local advocate. In addition the husband’s family may frustrate your attempts at justice by filing transfer petitions to delay and force you to surrender.

Don’t engage in any side income business, such as Amway etc after marriage, just because your non-Bengali husband etc is doing it. Bengalis got better education to get better paying jobs so that they don’t have to do this. Bengalis earn money to save, spend on their children’s education and for travel. If your non-Bengali partner is not appreciative of this then perhaps you need to choose a different person. That said if you have a genuine business idea then by all means jump full fledged into it.

>Modi, Law-and-Order and Hindutva 
 
-------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Modi has successfully cultivated the image of a 
no-nonsense, law-and order politician among Gujarat voters. 
This image of Modi as a strong, decisive leader is what his BJP 
supporters hope will help him establish a foothold at the 
national level. 
 
11. (C) Modi's role in the 2002 bloodshed continues to divide 
Gujaratis and Indians in general.  While he remains repugnant to 
large numbers of people, particularly Muslims, human rights 
activists and educated urbanites with liberal or leftist 
leanings, many in the Hindu majority view his actions in 2002 
favorably.  Negative attitudes towards Muslims remain firmly 
anchored among Gujarati Hindus.  Many feel that they, and not 
the Muslim minority, are the true second class citizens of 
India.  Muslims often ""stepped out of line,"" prior to 2002, we 
often hear, demanding and receiving exceptional treatment by 
politicians who felt the need to placate them on the basis of 
perceived injustices carried out by the Hindu majority.  That 
changed when Modi came into power in 2002, they say.  While no 
one will openly condone the bloodshed of 2002, many Gujarati 
Hindus feel that Modi ""put Muslims into their place.""  The BJP 
continues to echo these themes in its national political stance, 
especially over issues such as Hajj subsidies, the Muslim civil 
code, the singing of Vande Mataram, or other such religiously 
sensitive concerns. 
 
12. (C) Modi continues to support a Hindutva agenda in the 
state, with the recent passage of amendments to the state's 
anti-conversion law (ref A) being seen as a concession to his 
supporters on the Hindu right.  Both supporters and critics of 
Modi confirm that the state government continues to use 
administrative tools to marginalize and ghettoize the Muslim 
minority. 
 
13. (C) At the same time, most interlocutors tell us that Modi 
cannot gain anything more by openly pursuing an aggressive 
Hindutva agenda.  He already has the backing of those who 
applaud his firm stand against Muslims, and he risks alienating 
swing voters in Gujarat by being too openly communal.  Modi 
understands that, outside of Gujarat, his role in the 2002 riots 
has damaged both his reputation and that of the state.  He also 
realizes that outbreaks of communal violence in Gujarat will 
harm both his chances in the state and nationally, and hence he 
has given law enforcement agencies clear instructions to act 
swiftly if violence breaks out, we have been told.  Several 
interlocutors cited Modi's rapid reaction to the communal 
rioting in Vadodara in May (ref B) as proof of his new strategy. 
 Modi allowed federal army troops to establish order, and he 
even visited hospitalized Muslim victims of the riots in an 
attempt to portray himself as a leader of all Gujaratis.

India is colonising Kashmir the same away the British Colonial Government had once enslaved India for centuries. India has become its own worst nightmare.

“We are protecting you from indignity.” said the Europeans while enslaving the Africans.

“We are protecting you from hunger.” said the French while starving the Vietnamese.

“We are protecting you from terrorism.” said the Indians while terrorising the Kashmiris.

All of this transpiring around the holy occasion of Eid. This shows just how “concerned” India is about the welfare of the Kashmiri muslims. Imagine India under siege during Diwali.

India has become a tyrannical regime.  


**EDIT**: For the dim in need of clarification as if it wasn't deafeningly obvious already: I'm for Kashimir's independence from India, Pakistan, and any other foreign element. Kashmir only belongs to the Kashmiris. To deny their right is to commit an **unforgivable** war crime. Kashmir's fate post its independence shouldn't be anyone's concern but of the Kashmiris.

Checks out a lot of boxes when it comes to fascism. Lot of parallels to how Uighurs are being treated in China. IDs being checked every few metres. Surveillance. Regulation of every movement. Limited communication. Closing off neighborhoods from each other. Doing all this in the name of protecting ordinary citizen from terrorism. The PSA does that in Kashmir and UAPA once it\'s in effect will take care of the rest of India.\n\nB) We are paper democracy now. The way they\'ve been passing bills with major problems. For instance, the UAPA bill, RTI one, NMC bill, Transgender bill, Surrogacy bill shows that they give zero hoots about what the concerned community wants and are furthering their own agenda to gain utmost power. \n\nC) Changing syllabi in courses. Altering historical facts. Pushing subtle beliefs through control of media and censorship. Propaganda is never in your face, it\'s subtle and that\'s what\'s exactly happening in India. People are gobbling it up in the name of patriotism\n\nD) Industrialists are being favoured. Privatisation. We a corporate oligarchy now people. \n\nE) It\'s been reported that they took assistance of Isreali tactical experts to close off neighborhoods in Kashmir from one another. From the looks of it, they\'re definitely looking to change the demography of the state. Lot of people seem okay with it because according to them it will bring about stability in the area. Why can\'t people call it out like it is? Ethnic cleansing. Kashmiris don\'t want to leave their state but they\'ll be forced to.PSA and UAPA will take care of any protesters. Kashmiri Muslims will continue being oppressed in the name of protecting India from terrorists.\n\nF) Industries will setup in Kashmir and bring their employees from their states. Kashmiris might be used for labour work but they\'ll hardly get positions of importance. Tourism sector which was solely in their hands will now be shared with people from other states. They\'ll lose jobs and land. Will be forced to migrate somewhere else. \n\nG) People will keep saying, ""But Kashmiri Pandits!?"". Yes, that was fucking horrifying but that doesn\'t justify what\'s happening. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. The people in the valley never wanted to be a part of India but they were forced by then Hari Singh. They rebeled. They were slaughtered in lakhs by RSS. The valley is trapped in a vicious cycle of violence and looks like it\'s never going to end. \n\nH) If you can believe that the US government funded Al-Qaeda so they could take over the Middle East, it\'s not far-fetched to believe that the Indian government can do something along the same lines ( Re: Pulwama) to further their agenda of taking over Kashmir. I am just being hypothetical here but yeah I have no faith in this government anymore.\n\nTL;DR : Democracy is dead in Kashmir. Rest of India is next. Fascism will eventually come for all of us. Maybe not with a bang on the door but slipping in through the gaps around it.', ""To set your facts right, Kashmir was a Hindu-dominated region with Kashmiri Shaivism being one of the biggest contributors to Hinduism long before the Muslims invaders came in, plundered the wealth, looted the region, forced conversions and established a sizable Muslim population there.\n\nNow, Kashmir belongs to Muslims and Pandits both. I belong to J&K, and can very well tell you that I welcome the move made by the government. What's happening is a transitional phase and will eventually fade out. The damage done by 370 and 35(A) has only helped fuel the personal ambitions of a handful few in the valley while common people have barely made any progress.\n\nIf you are not a Kashmiri, please do not assume that you know the ground reality based on what you see in the media. Kashmir is very much part of India so stop fantasizing that it will ever go to Pakistan.\n\nThere never would have been a good time to bring this into action. Also, no untoward incident happened during Eid so don't try to say otherwise."", 'While I mostly agree or sympathise with what you have written, I do however want to comment on one of your statements:\n\n> The muslim PEOPLE of Kashmir DO NOT and NEVER HAVE wanted to be part of India. \n\nI admit that I haven\'t conversed with a lot of Kashmiris. The general idea I have got from what I have seen in the media and the few Kashmiris I have had the chance to speak to is that the above is not true. Almost all Kashmiris do not want to join Pakistan, they either want to be independent, or be a part of India. The rich and/or educated Kashmiri Muslims would rather be a part of India, as they see the economic and long term benefits of it. Kashmir doesn\'t have a coastline, it needs to be dependent on India/Pak/China for their imports/exports. The terrain of the state makes any sort of infrastructure development extremely costly, an independent state will struggle with investments. The strategic location of the state between India, China & Pakistan makes it extremely vulnerable defensively - even if it became independent, it would be dependent on one of these three countries to be able to defend herself. Again, due to the terrain, there is not much scope for a lot of industries to develop - that would make her economically dependent on one of her neighbours as well.\n\nDue to the above factors (and much much more), most educated Kashmiris realise that being an independent country is probably not going to be to their advantage. That\'s why Article 370 was to their advantage - they had some sort of autonomy, still could rely on India\'s economic capabilities to realise her own potential. Unfortunately 370 was never put to use in a progressive manner due to policies of both the state and national governments, leading us to where we are today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to Kashmiris wanting to join Pakistan, as I understand it is only a select few who hold that opinion. Most Kashmiris don\'t want this because they are afraid they will lose their identity if they become a part of Pakistan. A while back I was reading an article in a Kashmiri website, which was lamenting the decline of Kashmiri language and culture. It was complaining that due to the influence of Islamists, Urdu is slowly replacing the Kashmiri language in the valley. That is how it works in Pakistan - they want a forced homogeneity in language, religion and culture (kind of similar to what RSS is pushing towards with its Hindutva agenda).\n\nCase in point - language. Pakistan has a ""National"", and ""official"" state language, Urdu, unlike India, although Urdu is not a majority language in Pakistan. The most widely spoken language is Punjabi, which in Pakistan is written in a version of the Nastaliq script (Shahmukhi) instead of the Gurmukhi script used in India. In 1948, when Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan, a number of Hindu Bengalis led by Dhirendranath Datta raised the issue of language in the Pakistani parliament. They complained that Bengali was by far the most spoken language in Pakistan, it should be made the official language, not Urdu. Muslim Bengali legislators stayed silent as Liaquat Khan struck down the proposal, accusing Datta of trying to conspire against the state. 4 years later, 21st February 1952, a massive agitation broke out in Dhaka over language rights of the Bengalis. In 1956 after 4 years of conflict, Pakistan declared Urdu & Bengali to be co-official languages.

Your parents are correct. Don't fall into the trap of passion for subjects which don't pay well.,20.0,dhb1rl,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dhb1rl/your_parents_are_correct_dont_fall_into_the_trap/,138.0,"Hi people.

This post will be mainly for youngsters who are confused about their future and less for people who are already successful or are already regretting after doing the mistake.


I am a doc. I cleared all the competitive exams and everything back and now enjoy a good wage and respect from society. I have been observing my other classmates who didn't chose engineering medical or CA route and thought of following their passion in all other fields. And I have also spent some time seeing where they are now. Heck even had talk with some.

Your parents are completely justified and correct in forcing you to chose these 2-3 fields. You may be thinking WHAT. But the reality is quite shocking.

These fields are stable and pay handsomely. You don't need to be too great in them, especially medical, to earn a handsome salary. Heck even in engineering, if you are from IIT, average package is 8-10lpa. That will increase and get an IIM and you are set for 18-20lpa on AVERAGE (Do a little hard work and you are set for more. Do bit more and you can even go outside India) . I myself earn around 30lpa. It's not billion but it's average money and enough to survive I guess.

Now I have seen my humanities and other commerce friends with their degrees. By God unless you are at top, forget about even 8lpa. They are having ALOT of difficulties earning good money. They are basically living of their parents money. Some of the good looking ones go in sales and so they get advantage of their genetic looks there.

But overall I have seen that these professions give stability. One of my friend is a musician and he is STRUGGLING HARD. Guy thought he could earn by being an instrumentalist. He forgot he need to only be good at singing but he isn't. 

One is doing mass media and last I heard she was trying to change course due to saturation.

Ofc engineering is having plenty of failiure but getting a NIT/IIT is a bit hard work but a sureshot way of stability and success in life.

That's why your parents aren't against your passion but they are intelligent and prudent and know that money matters in the end and these are the only ways to get them!

And ""reasonable comfort"" differs from person to person.

I wanted to extend an invitation for you all to join us over at /r/IndianMuslims.

We're a fairly new sub that are largely focused on issues related to the Indian Muslim community at home and abroad and wanted to reach out to the broader Reddit Indian community. We'd love for our fellow Indians to join us in discussions and exploring our shared history and culture.

As most of you may know, India has the 3rd largest population of Muslims in the world (2nd by other estimates) despite only making 15-18% of the entire population in India. However, this has still led to a lot of misconceptions about the Muslims of India, our culture, our religious views, politics, etc. by both our fellow Indians and the broader Muslim community.

/r/IndianMuslims serves to give the Muslims of India as well as the diaspora of Indian Muslims on Reddit, a platform to discuss the many political and social issues affecting our community. We also aim to explore the Islamic culture of India through art, history, architecture, film, music, food, poetry, and other important factors that make us who we are in relation to India and the wider Muslim world.

All are welcomed, whether you are Muslim or non-Muslim, Indian or non-Indian. It doesn’t matter where you live, whether in India, Middle East/Gulf countries, North America, etc., you are all welcomed to be a part of our community.

Hope to see you all soon!

Rant - Fireworks on Diwali [NP],0.0,59k21h,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/59k21h/rant_fireworks_on_diwali_np/,87.0,"Vehicle emissions do not cause air pollution every day. Fireworks on Diwali are the sole cause of pollution. 

Your perverse honking on roads does not produce noise. Fireworks on Diwali deafen hundreds of people every year. 

A car accident has never ever harmed a human being. A firework accident, though, will instantly kill you. Especially one on Diwali. 

Roadkill is not even a problem for Indian animals. It is the fireworks that scare the living hell out of them. 

The amount of fuel you burn to drive that car of yours is worth nothing. It is only when you buy fireworks that you are ""literally burning your money."" 

Stop this nonsense. Diwali comes once a year, folks. Celebrate it the way you want to. If you're really concerned about the environment, give up your car for one month and take the bus or the train for a change. 

Let people choose how they want to celebrate this festival. I, like all those who possess a little bit of common sense, am aware that Diwali is a festival of light and not that of sound and smoke but I believe that saying no to fireworks is not how you should celebrate. 

You do you, fellas. Crackers or not, this Diwali be happy, safe and sane. :)

Are the students of Jamia Millia Islamia really interested in secularism? Evidence points to the contrary.,0.0,ee2yz1,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee2yz1/are_the_students_of_jamia_millia_islamia_really/,23.0,"Over the past week or so, we have seen violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across many states. The one that was probably reported the most was the protest by Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. News channels like NDTV and India Today repeatedly reported how the police used excessive force against “peaceful” protesters. We were told that the students were opposed to the omission of Muslims from the CAA and sought to fight against it to “save” Indian democracy and “secularism”.

&#x200B;

While going through posts on social media, I came across an interesting piece of information - that JMI reserved 50% of its seats for Muslims. Not having too much faith in the accuracy of social media posts, I wanted to verify if this was really the case. Because if it were, it would clearly show that JMI was anything but secular. And so I started to go through their official websites: www.jmi.ac.in and www.jmicoe.in. What I learnt during my research astounded me. I knew that Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment to Muslims over non-Muslims but I never expected it to be this bad. My article relies solely on the documents and information available on these two official websites. No third parties, no hearsay. All the sources and links are listed at the end of this article.

  
To begin with, the claim that 50% seats in JMI are reserved for Muslims is absolutely true. The following text has been taken from Page 30 of the 2018-19 prospectus of JMI. (as can be seen in the attached image)

  
5.1  
(i) 30% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Muslim applicants.  
(ii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Women applicants who are Muslims.  
(iii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for “Other Backward Classes” (OBCs) and Scheduled Tribes who are Muslims.  
Note: If seats remain vacant in any program from amongst the 10% of the total number of seats earmarked as per 5.1 (ii) and (iii) above, such vacant seats shall stand transferred to the category 5.1(i),i.e., Muslim applicants.

  
In other words, 30% seats for Muslim applicants + 10% for Muslim women + 10% for Muslim OBC. If there are any vacant seats from the Muslim women or Muslim OBC category, then those seats would be transferred to other Muslim applicants. So there would AT LEAST 50% seats for Muslims in JMI. Why do I say at least 50%? Well, apart from the 50% reservation for Muslims, there’s 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (or PwD). This reservation for PwDs is not limited Muslims only but since the selection of students would be done by the JMI staff, they could opt for Muslims over PwDs from other religions. And on top of that, there’s 5% reservation for “Internal (Jamia) students” i.e. students of Jamia who have passed their qualifying examination (X or XII) from Jamia Schools. And given that the same 50% reservation policy for Muslims exists in Jamia schools, the students from this category could all be Muslims. So on the whole, there could be up to a maximum of 60% Muslims from the reserved categories.

  
But wait, it gets a lot worse!! There could be far more than 60% Muslims in a program / course. How? Because Muslims can also get admissions in the General category !!! In other words, 50% seats are reserved for Muslims only i.e. only Muslims can opt for these seats. Of the 5% reserved seats for PwDs, Muslims can be given preference. And 5% reservation for internal jamia students would almost certainly be all Muslims. On top of that, there would be Muslim applicants in the General category i.e. Muslims students who opt for admissions not via reservation but in the general category. So in the end, the percentage of Muslim students could be way more than 60%.

  
To find out the exact proportion of Muslim students, one would require the list of all admissions in a particular program / course. I did find the list of all admissions for the year 2019-20 but since those lists display only the registration number of the students and not their name and religion, it cannot be used to determine the exact number of Muslim students. However I did find the list of graduated students for the year 2018. This list mentions the name of the candidates in addition to the registration number. Here’s what I found:

  
a. In B.Tech Computer Engineering, 37 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 59%.  
b. In B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 40 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 64%.  
c. In B.Tech Mechanical Engineering, 43 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 66%.  
d. In B.Tech Civil Engineering, 51 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 78%.

  
Assuming that the proportion of students in admission and graduation would be more-or-less the same, this data not only confirmed my suspicions that the percentage of Muslim students in various courses would be least 60% but went on to show that it may be as high as 80%. I analysed the data for these four streams of engineering. There are several other courses but I did not spend my time analysing each and every single one. For those who are interested to dig deeper, relevant links can be found at the end of this article. 

  
I then looked into scholarships i.e. what percentage of the total number of students who received scholarships were Muslims. Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI) is tasked with providing scholarships for JMI students. I found the list of the selected candidates for the current year.

  
In the first list, out of the 325 selected candidates, 303 are Muslims; which is 93% !!  And in the second list, 96 out of the 99 candidates are Muslims i.e. 97%. In other words, of all the students who received scholarship in 2019, approximately 95% were Muslims.

  
This data conclusively proves that an overwhelming majority of students at JMI are Muslims and that Muslims are given preferential treatment. I wondered if the same pattern holds true for the positions of deans and Heads of Department (HODs). And predictably enough, JMI does not disappoint !!

  
Of the 37 heads of various departments, 32 are Muslim i.e. 86%. And when it comes to the Deans of faculties, 8 of the 9 are Muslim = 89% !! (Annual Report 2017-18)

  
Finally, I went through the list of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of JMI. By now, I’m sure you can guess what I would have found. Of the 11 Chancellors since 1920, not one is a non-Muslim. And the same holds true for VCs. Not one of the 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 is a non-Muslim.

  
So in the end, *60-80% of the students, 95% of scholarship recipients, 86% of the HODs, approximately 90% of the Deans of faculties*, and all the past & present Chancellors & Vice Chancellors of JMI are Muslims !! And yet, they claim to fight for ""secularism"" !!!

  
Ask yourself these simple questions:  
1. How serious can the students of such a university be about “secularism”?  
2. Should we as a nation pay any heed to their demands given their shameless hypocrisy?  
3. If they indeed were such strong believers in the idea of secularism then wouldn’t they start by secularising their own university first?  
4. Do the students and professors of this university have a moral right to oppose ANY act on the grounds of secularism?

  
For any unbiased reader, this article conclusively proves that the JMI is not interested in secularism in the least. Then why are they protesting CAA? In my opinion, the reasons are:  
1. Supreme Court’s decision in favour of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  
2. Belief that Muslims must be loyal to fellow Muslims over the country i.e. Muslim Ummah (or Ummat).  
3. Rightly / wrongly concluding that NRC will be bad.

  
It is also very interesting how leftists / liberals and Muslims have learnt the subtle art of appropriating the Constitution to suit their own agenda. Everybody has heard the accusation that the CAA violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. One can find many Muslims, and non-Muslims, repeating the same crap. It is however very interesting that Muslims are demanding equality and cite Article 14 as the justification. Well, if they are so bent upon equality, then why don’t they accept the demand for Universal Civil Code (UCC)? NO!! You see, when the debate is about UCC, they quote Article 25 of the Constitution which gives the right to practice one’s own religion and claim various special privileges as a religious right; for eg. four wives, triple talaq, etc. And when the discussion pertains to giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries, they jump to Article 14 !! In other words, they pick and choose that which suits them.

  
So the next time you meet a leftist/liberal or Muslim who says that they oppose CAA because it goes against Article 14 and the principle of equal treatment, ask him if he supports Universal Civil Code. If he denies or gives you a lengthy nonsensical answer as to why he opposes UCC, then he stands exposed ; proving that he / she is not really interested in secularism. 

  
It is amazing that channels like NDTV who claim to present facts as they are have never seen fit to inform Indians about the vastly disproportionate number of Muslim students in JMI. Nor do they call out the hypocrisy of JMI “students”. If they would have, the whole country would have learnt that these protests have nothing to do with “secularism”.

  
Now it is up to us to spread the word. Please share / forward this article so that the truth about JMI is known to everyone.

Some politicians in BJP/RSS try to impose, but you can still negotiate that by protest and moving to the supreme court(million ways to deter center to impose Hindi). 

But why do you constantly attack north Indians of being poor, illiterate, not being able to speak English, enforcing Hindi on an ordinary south Indian? 


",Non-Political,False,0.54,"['You\'re fighting a strawman here. Hindi *in* Tamil Nadu - most parts of it anyway - are completely useless for the average Tamilian.  \n  \nWhen Tamilians leave Tamil Nadu, they do learn Hindi. A large number of Tamils live in parts of Mumbai and originate from southern coastal Tamil Nadu, and they speak Hindi like native speakers of Hindi. [An example](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/once-south-indians-were-beaten-up-in-mumbai-now-the-city-has-a-tamil-mla/20141020.htm).   \n  \nI do not speak for other Tamils. My objection around this is centered around two facts   \n  \n1. Languages become extinct or endangered when people no longer use them. [This has happened to Mayan languages in Central and South America](http://aboutworldlanguages.com/mayan-language-family), which have lost precedence to Spanish. If Hindi is ""imposed"" on Tamils, there is a decent chance this could happen to Tamil as well. It could take some time, but it will absolutely happen.  \n  \n2. To make a Tamil *in Tamil Nadu* learn Hindi *for no reason* is useless. I made a comprehensive post in September about why [this is bad](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4vqxiz/ysk_that_india_has_many_different_language/). Tl;dr: Hindi is useless since it comes from a completely different language family than Tamil. So does English, so maybe if Tamils know English they can optionally learn Hindi. Shoving it down the throats of people living in rural and middle Tamil Nadu is something Tamils have violently objected to in the past and may do so in the future again.  \n  \nThere is no concept of ""English elitism"". There is only utility that I see and English is more useful than Hindi the way the Tamil Nadu economy is structured now. It would be completely delusional to say Hindi is more useful than English for a service-based economy. [Source](http://www.mse.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Monograph-17.pdf)  \n  \n> In Tamil Nadu, the service sector is the main driver of the overall economic\ngrowth of the state and among the services the sub - sector comprising the\ntrade, hotels and restaurants is the dominant one, followed by the banking and\ninsurance, and real estates.   \n  \nIf Tamil Nadu needed to learn Hindi in order to facilitate economic benefits for themselves, then they would do so automatically. I think Hindi should be learned organically by people, and it should **not** be upto a bunch of people sitting in Delhi trying to shove it down anyones throats.  \n  \nHindi\'s status as ""India\'s most spoken language"" is arbitrary anyway - it exists that way because the population ran out of control in states where it was spoken. How is in Tamil Nadus fault that 400 million more people *weren\'t* born in Tamil Nadu, and therefore the state has to take second class status to Hindi?  \n   \nHindi\'s ""dominance"" is only because   \n \n- people didn\'t wear condoms and had way too many kids      \n- people who pick up Hindi can do so way more easily because it shares a language family with other languages. A Punjabi or a Gujarati or even someone speaking a localized language in UP or Bihar can pick up, learn and speak Hindi easier and more intuitively than a Tamil can. This doesn\'t mean a Tamil can\'t, but I think the difference is similar to a Danish person being able to learn Swedish vs a Turkish person being able to learn Swedish.  \n  \nGiven all this, I vehemently oppose any moves by any government in the center to try to be smart and start pushing Hindi at people in Tamil Nadu. This may seem like ""snobbery"" or ""elitism"" or ""Tamil exceptionalism"" to you, but honestly I could not care.  \n  \nI know what I know - that languages in Europe and South America have died due to the dominance of other languages, and it will be difficult to convince me to let that happen to Tamil as well. *Especially* given Hindi\'s completely arbitrary status as a ""dominant"" language and its total lack of utility as a bridge language to trade outside India.

I think everyone in India should learn Hindi,8.0,75v8ou,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/75v8ou/i_think_everyone_in_india_should_learn_hindi/,77.0,"Before you freak out, hear me out. I am a south Indian so I have a unique experience with the issue. I was born and raised in Hyderabad and am elsewhere now. So right from the beginning I have learned Telugu (Mother tongue), English and Hindi. I think I can maintain a conversation in Hindi but my accent is bad. I can read and write Hindi quite well.

Everyone should learn their mother tongue first and foremost. So a telugu guy should learn telugu. A marathi guy should learn marathi. That is the first priority.

Now the question is: Should you also learn Hindi? I think every Indian should learn Hindi.

The reasons IMO are as follows :-

1. You can connect with 40% of Indian people. 
2. Only 9% of Indians can speak English. This means you literally cannot talk to you many of your compatriots in the state we are in.
3. If everyone learns Hindi then every Indian can talk to each other. This improves the national fabric and brings us closer to each other.
4. English is and always will be a foreign language. Indians will never be able to truly own and embody a foreign language.

For too long the upper echelons of power in our country were run in English which only 9% people understand. Everyone else has been left out and they feel wronged and rightly so.

Of course, the devil lies in the details. What should be the priority? Even i don't know the answer to that.

Ideally every Indian should speak their mother tongue, Hindi and English and use which ever is convenient. If you are making a political speech in Hindi states use Hindi because you will connect with more people. If you are writing a scientific paper english would be a better choice.

That is all I have to say now, the only form of dissent available to me.  I am too small to rally against a government that has power over the public discourse, the tools and purveyors of justice and the very people itself. The government has taken over what I eat, what I see and what I read. It has also slowly taken away what I believe or at least what I used to believe in. The pride with which the mass thumps its chest as majoritarian while also contributing to a dictatorial view of the government that was elected is bothersome. It shows me that what is on paper is not in the minds of people, the rot has now reached a far deeper. There is no more intelligentsia that looks at problems objectively, the best minds converted to conformity or chased away.

What is the pride in defending a country whose economy is about to falter? What is the pride in identifying with a mass? Why is there celebration over a perceived national and religious unity whereas basic necessities are not available to large swathes of the population and the country is built on a tattering education system that only reproduces but does not think? The colour of faith and national pride stops us from seeing the problems that plague us elsewhere, trying to pretend that our problems do not exist or trying to save face before the rest of the world is not a magic pill. The country was built on shaky foundations of poverty and misinformation, the political forces that followed have reaped merry on these resources. This could also be termed as a post-colonial hunt for identity and there is enough theory written, the practice is based on emotion and fear. No amount of sense can be breathed upon a person subsumed by thought control.

Seeing the temple being built reaffirms that there is no longer a future in this country. All for what? A mythical character in a story who would not have cared if one worshipped him or not. Where the biggest issues is of an outside enemy the bigger problems that plague the country go unanswered. Since most of the population does not have a conception of what the Western idea of development is (thanks to shoddy education amongst other things) they are happy to accept what they get at face value. Today it is a mandir, tomorrow it is a pogrom. Who is to care? After all they are the majority and they feel powerful. This will not end here. Kashmir was the soup and this is the starter. It will not end before the Hindutva agenda is firmly pressed down our throats. The new generation will be an anal, flag flying and name chanting drones like the Turkish or Chinese goons that are also baying for blood. The ideals that shaped this country have been distorted and I have no longer have any hope for democracy or inclusion.

I am not siding with this anymore. When the day comes when we hang our heads in shame I will not shrug and repent. Because I am not a part of this madness. The best I can do it to renounce all my affiliation with this ideology from now on. Mark my words for it will Kashi and Mathura next. And who knows what rhyming, emotionally upbeat rally call will be next. I will be called a troll, a Pakistani or shown examples of Israelis or the Muslims. My counter will be, two wrongs will not make a right and I will first try to resolve the problems of my house before embarking on a global change mission. So far I am failing though I hope not for long.

I am one of those haters and through this post I want all of you to walk through my mind so you know the reasons on how I or any other Islam-hater became one.

Lets start from when I was a fairly neutral hindu guy.I believed in(still do) that all religions are equal,for they are different means to same god.I was as secular as a good Hindu/Sikh could be. 

Then I hear about what muslims did to Kashmiri Pandits.How they killed them and threatened them to either convert or fuck off from their 1000 year old homeland.I found out about how mob of them killed 60 innocent hindu pilgrims which initiated the 2002 Godhra riots.About how they raped a hindu girl and killed her brothers(reason for Mujaffarnagar riots).Currently these Muslims are busy playing riot-riots with Sikhs when the court orders were unfavourable to them.

Not to mention what they are doing outside India - killing,converting minorities in Pak since Independence,terrorizing whole world with organisations like Al-Qaeda,Boko Haram and ISIS.

Muslims are doing these kind of chutiyapas all over the world and you still want me to believe they are religion of peace? Get your mind checked.

You say these are acts of only few and blaming whole Islam is not justified? 

How many more instances do you want before you drop your argument of *don't generalise muslims*? I would be happy to serve you more mate,I have plenty.

Islam is one big-time fucked up religion which will never be in peace with others.You know why? Because their holy texts doesn't preach so.People of a religion are as good as their holy text,for it is what guides their behaviour.Hindus are peaceful and secular because of Vedas,Sikhs for Guru Granth Sahib and so on for Buddhists and Jains.And what does Koran teach? To kill and hate non-believers for they don't realise greatness of Islam? 

What kind of Kuran is it which tells followers to deny equal rights to women while their men can fuck and marry as much girls as they want?

Why don't muslims questions these kind of practices ? Why do they take them for granted as 'order of god' ?

Then while he was stepping doing , the presenter was crying out like the presenter announcing Mike Tyson's name over the microphone ring-style and asking the people to chant Modi Modi, what exactly is the PR machinery doing?

"(conspiracy theory warning) What if this ""rape culture"" media hype is a kind of psychological warfare being funded by the US?",0.0,2yfpxm,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2yfpxm/conspiracy_theory_warning_what_if_this_rape/,28.0,"There's certainly a social problem to be combated here, but that's the way these things work - by trojaning themselves into a popular good cause, and slowly corrupting it from the inside. Take the now popular BBC documentary - perhaps the idea is proposed from a good intention of exposing the issues involved, but somebody sees the opportunity, greases some palms, and involves themselves; maybe they change the content slightly to generalize things beyond the incident it's based on, maybe they simply ensure it's marketed in a way that's helpful to their own propaganda. It's even possible that our govt came across some intelligence of such ideas planned based on the documentary, leading to the much-maligned ban - I have no evidence to believe this, I'm just saying that a lot of things could be going on behind the scenes.

The US definitely understands the power of media in the modern world, and India and China are the two major nations that are perceived as new and developing threats to US. 

""Rape epidemic"" was a bad enough term, but by tagging us as a ""rape culture"" entirely, India is affected on multiple fronts: 

* Tourism - a segment this govt sees the potential of (see ""Swacch Bharath"" and comments by PM elsewhere) - will be paralyzed entirely as people automatically think ""rape"" when they think of India. 

* Whether or not this ""German professor"" thing is true, if this ""rape culture"" tag is allowed to enter the popular consciousness, such things will factor in at least unconsciously in the minds of deciding authorities - when deciding university admissions, job interviews, visa interviews, etc., all of it dampening India's growth. 

* If a mass hysteria builds, people get emotional, and demand lots of visible and psychologically satisfying security in place - which is what is called ""security theater"". So, the administration's resources would have to be wasted on ""security theater"" rather than actual security, which again slows growth. 

I don't know how much of a probability I myself will attach to this theory, but I hope this at least gets some of you thinking about such possibilities. [Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_%28United_States%29#Cold_War) a small subset of the US's PsyOps done decades ago, I hope you can extrapolate how much went unexposed and how much their techniques would have been ""improved"" in the decades since.

EXPOSE OF FAKE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST PANKAJA MUNDE,2.0,3b8mtj,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3b8mtj/expose_of_fake_allegations_against_pankaja_munde/,30.0,"The allegations being made on the Pankaja Munde,Minister for Women and Child Development, Govt. of Maharashtra are politically motivated and baseless. These allegations are false cries and are disgusting. These allegations made by the opposition have been completely punctured after a point by point here.

1. Allegation : The different purchases worth Rs. 206 Cr. For Anganwadis was carried out without eTendering process

Reality : This is a false allegation. The purchases made by Women and Child Development Department have been done based on Govt. Approved Rate Contracts. eTendering is not needed when the Rate Contracts are available.

2. Allegation : The Government Resolutions related to the purchase have not been uploaded on the Govt. Website

Reality : As these are purchase related work orders, they were not put on the govt. website. In the tenure of the previous governments also, Govt. Resolutions related to any of the purchases were not put on the website

3. Allegation : The purchase was approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha

Reality : The rate contract was approved on verification of all the points associated with the manufacturing units of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha by the Technical Team of the CSPO. The Women and Child Development Department has also verified the unit. Therefore the allegation that the purchases were approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity is wrong.

4. Allegation : The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved in only one day

Reality : Rate Contract is available for M/s Bhavani Enterprises and therefore the purchase was approved. However, the propaganda being made in this regard is completely false. The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved on the basis of Govt. Rules and Laid Down process.

5. Allegation : The contracts were allotted to unauthorized Firms

Reality : This allegation is also an utter falsehood. The purchase orders were allotted to the firms authorized in Rate Contracts provided by the approved agencies. Contracts are not allotted to any unauthorized firm.

6. Allegation : M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. does not have copyright registration

Reality : Shree Tekawade has done the copyright consent agreement with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. In this, as per the Terms and Conditions of the contract, the rights for printing, selling, and publication of the associated books are available with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd and therefore purchase order was given to M/s Jagadguru Printing Press.

7. Allegation : Cheque of value of Rs. 5.6 crores was credited into the account of the contractor

Reality : This allegation is also a complete falsehood. The Commissioner of Women and Child Development has issued the cheque in the same of the associated firm i.e. M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. The cheque was not issued in the same of any individual.

8. Allegation : The Water Filter of value Rs. 4500 was purchased at Rs. 5200.

Reality : The Govt. Rate contract mentions the cost of Water Filter at Rs. 4500/- and Water Filter with Storage Capacity at Rs. 5200/-. The water filter with storage capacity has been purchased and therefore the allegations made in this regard are baseless and misleading for the people. The water filter with storage capacity has been done based only on the costs mentioned in the Rate Contract.

9. Allegation : M/s Suryakanta does not have its plant to manufacture Chikki

Reality : M/s Suryakanta has its own plant. This plant is at Vengurla and it has been verified.

10. Allegation : The provision for Medical Kits was for Rs. 500 and yet, Rs. 720 were charged.

Clarification: This allegation is also completely false and misleading. Medical Kits have been purchased based on the provisions of the Central Govt. at Rs. 599/-. As per the Terms and Conditions mentioned in the Tender, The Commissioner (Integrated Child Development Scheme) has the rights to change the quantity of the Medicines and the cost of Medical Kit was reduced to Rs.599/- from Rs. 720/- to fit into the limit of Central Govt. of Rs. 600/-.

Misinformation in regards to eTendering

The state govt. has issued a GR through General Administration Department on 18. December 2014, making it mandatory for carrying out purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs. However, this tender is for carrying out e Tendering instead of paper based Tendering for all purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs and therefore for any of the purchases, if the Rate Contracts are already available, e Tendering is not required. The purchases done by the Women and Child Development Department are as per the Rules and Regulations as mentioned above. These purchases are done on the basis of the Rate Contracts finalized by the Director General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS & D) of the Industries Department and Central Government. Also, all the purchases were made in FY 2014-15 i.e. before March 2015.
However, the Government Orders, making e Tendering mandatory for any purchases above Rs. 1 Crore even if the Rate Contract are available, were issued after this period, i.e. on 17. April 2015. However, it may be noted that the above purchases were done before March 2015. Therefore the question of carrying out eTendering for purchases above Rs. 1 Crores did not arise.
If the decision of the aforementioned purchases was not taken, it would not have been possible to utilize the funds in the then current Financial Year i.e. before 31. March 2015. These funds would have been lapsed and the funds would not be available for the anganwadi children and the funds would have been available only in the new financial year with a delay. The Central Govt. share in this funds would have been lapsed and would not have be available again. In the mean time, the beneficiaries of this schemes would be completely neglected and the supplies would have been shut for them.

The purchases of the previous govt. on the basis of the same Rate Contract

It may be noted that the Rate Contract used for above mentioned purchases were finalized in the time of the previous Congress-NCP Govt. Also, the previous Congress-NCP Govt. did purchases on the basis of the same Rate Contracts. It needs to be understood that the purchases of Rs. 164 Crores in 2012-13, Rs. 127 Crores in 2013-14 ad Rs. 56 Crores in June-July 2014 have been made.

TIL that Voltaire was a communal Hindutva bigot,0.0,3pvlok,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3pvlok/til_that_voltaire_was_a_communal_hindutva_bigot/,43.0,"[Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire#Islam) is known to most of us as a great French Enlightenment thinker, writer and philosopher, as the writer of *Candide* and as an [infinitely quotable](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/v/voltaire.html) man (responsible for such iconic lines as ""Common sense is not so common"" and ""The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing"".

This was a man I indeed held in very high esteem - until today, that is because today I learned that many of his views were eerily similar to right-wing extremist Hindutva chickenhawks (sanghis) -

* **He believed Hinduism and India to be cradle of all civilization, the source of all knowledge, literature, mathematics etc.**

 >I am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges, - astronomy, astrology, metempsychosis, etc... It is very important to note that some 2,500 years ago at the least Pythagoras went from Samos to the Ganges to learn geometry...But he would certainly not have undertaken such a strange journey had the reputation of the Brahmins' science not been long established in Europe.

 – Voltaire, Lettres sur l'origine des sciences et sur celle des peuples de l'Asie (first published Paris, 1777), letter of 15 December 1775.

* **He considered the Islamic invaders of India as ""barbarians""**

 >No sooner than India begin to be known to the Occident's barbarians than she was the object of their greed, and even more so when these barbarians became civilised and industrious, and created new needs for themselves.... The Albuquerques and their successors succeeded in supplying Europe with pepper and paintings only through carnage

 – Voltaire, Fragments historiques sur l'Inde, op.cit., p.383


* **He was very fond of Hindus and Hinduism**

 In contrast to his views on their invaders, he viewed Hindus as ""peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves"". 

 He also said about Vedas that ""The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East"".

* **His views on Christianity and Islam**

 He wrote this about Christianity in a letter to King of Prussia -

 >**[Christianity] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world.** Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. … My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out..

 His opinion about Islam wasn't much better.

 He described Mohammed as a ""deceitful character."" He wrote that **Mohammed was ""whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command.""**

 He considered Quran to be ignoring the laws of physics. Thus, there are a number of representations of Mohammed by Voltaire, a religious one, according to which Mohammed is a prophet like the others, who exploits people's naivety and spreads superstition and fanaticism, and the other a political one, according to which Mohammed was a legislator who brought his contemporaries out of idolatry. According to Diego Venturino, Voltaire applauds the legislator but hates the conqueror and the pontiff, who established his religion through violence.

Unpopular Opinion: Emergency of 1975-77 was actually very good for the common man,0.0,a392je,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a392je/unpopular_opinion_emergency_of_197577_was/,30.0,"Yesterday, we were having a debate about national politics in our society and suddenly the topic of emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 75-77 came up. While everyone was criticizing this move, there was this one uncle who stood his ground that emergency time was not at all bad for the common man, in fact it was very good.

This uncle used to work in a public sector bank at that time and he says that efficiency of working improved a great deal, employees started coming to offices on time, and worked hard. Corruption had reduced to almost non-existent levels as corrupt employees were afraid of taking bribes because now the govt. agencies had increased powers to arrest them. Be it traffic cops, railway clerks or bank employees, everyone worked efficiently and the end result was a better society for the common dude who worked honestly.

The only people who weren't happy with emergency were political opposition and the media. Political opponents did come together in the form of JP movement (just as maha-gatbandhan is now) but that movement fizzled out soon because there was no ideological unity among them, except everyone wanted Indira Gandhi to go.

Here's my take on this whole AIB Tanmay issue.,0.0,6nkemu,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nkemu/heres_my_take_on_this_whole_aib_tanmay_issue/,62.0,"So since couple of days this AIB incident has picked up quite a bit of pace since Congress has jumped in the issue. I've seen like 3 posts on Randia discussing on the same issue. I want to share what I've noticed and how we are looking for the convenient bashing to pour out our anger or possibly targeted anger. I am not associated with any party btw.

Now coming to the issue. Its unfortunate. That's only I can say for the original tweet of Tanmay Bhatt. Randians are getting carried away into believing that this whole issue was only because of Dog Filter on snapchat. Well at least that's what people are trying to discuss all over Randia and making it a FOE argument.

What no is talking about is that TB used an innocent man's picture who probably looked like Modi and mocked him on Social media most probably without taking his permission to use the photo. (He has not clarified whether he took the permission or not and I doubt that person will allow to use his photo to become a laughing stock on the internet.)
Now here I find it is morally and ethically wrong to use some innocent man's photo to target some other person in this case Modi to score some brownie points on the internet. Whoever posted his original picture probably without his permission just so he can use him to target someone else in this case Modi is also at fault but Since TB is running a startup on Internet, has quite a bit of good fan following. Shouldn't he be more careful and responsible about such stuff?


What I find ironic is that Congress has jumped in this issue to score their political goals thinking this is good for their publicity and revival of their party in the upcoming election. Its amusing since many Congressis have uploaded ""their"" picture with dog filter to troll their opponent. People started trolling as well. It probably became a pissing contest which is kind of disgusting IMO. But no one thought about that old man whose picture is being circulated on the Internet and how he might be feeling in all this.

Now I've seen like 3 top threads on Randia being discussed on the same issue as I have said earlier but I have not seen the same amount of outrage for that 17yo boy who got arrested in Bengal. Seems like FOE rant is justified based on the ability to manipulate the incident in the favor of those who wants to take advantage out of it.

This is just what I observed and I wanted to share it with my Randian fellows. There might be many errors so kindly pardon me. This was written in haste. No hard feelings friends.

Edit: Seems I am being continuously down voted. Randia is not what it use to be.

So it is really curious that so many of AAP's own candidates have criminal charges in these elections and the same AAP leaders and same supporters turn HYPOCRITE and desperately defend them instead of asking their party to investigate these charges.

I realize that with their mental conditioning most AAP fanboys will just downvote without reading or spew abuse against me. And that the massive AAP social media machine will quickly mobilize trolls from across facebook, twitter and reddit to bury this post for the sake of their 'honest politics'.

**But I appeal to anyone *genuinely* concerned about clean politics: Please read this post and read the link I have given.** I have checked the report thoroughly and there are indeed 21 AAP candiates with criminal charges, of which many are serious.

-Rioting

-Assault

-Criminal Intimidation

-Cheating

-Counterfeiting money

-Death by negligence

-Sexual assault

And so on. **Please think before posting: If these people did not belong to AAP would you automatically declare them as innocent and wrongfully accused? Or would you be skeptical of them and their 'clean' politics?**

Modi Government : lack of talent,2.0,3jgjqo,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3jgjqo/modi_government_lack_of_talent/,56.0,"A lot of people have criticised the Narendra Modi government for being light intellectually. They say unlike the UPA the NDA lacks the necessary talent (bureaucrats and technocrats , many of whom have left the government because the government refuses to work with them like Amitabh Kant) and is filling the gap which academics, and technocrats should fill , with under educated individuals . And this shows up in lack lustre implementation of policies.

A prime example of this is the Jan Dhan Yojana which was another Congress policy implemented and taken credit for by this government.

According to the latest statistics 54% of the accounts have no money in them . While that number has come down from 76%. Its more or less found its bottom.

Considering its costs the government 125 rupees per account to maintain these accounts. The cost to the exchequer is actually around 1000 crore. Most banks are in fact not even breaking even.

This is a classic example of the government and how Modi lack the necessary talent to both implement policy and make new ones.

I am not a Pak sympathizer, I am just looking at the issue really critically. Because for now, all we have is a before and after picture of the burnt boat. Couple of years ago, the Italian marines shot two fishermen and tried to twist the story, as soon as they knew they fucked up. What do you guys think?

Update: http://m.firstpost.com/india/terror-boat-or-not-what-you-need-to-know-about-pakistan-vessel-that-exploded-2028573.html just a little more clarity.

In a midnight operation in the high seas on New Year's Eve, a Pakistani fishing boat said to be carrying explosives was intercepted by the Indian Coast Guard off the shores of Gujarat, but the vessel exploded and caught fire before sinking along with four occupants.

The incident, which occurred some 365 km off the coast of Porbander, generated strong speculation that it was another attempted attack of the kind Mumbai witnessed in 2008, when 10 terrorists landed in south Mumbai from the sea and killed over 170 people at the Taj, the Trident and the CST suburban station.

While Pakistan rejected such reports, the defence ministry said they had received intelligence information that helped them intercept the boat.

Here's all you need know about the incident which has worsened already sour ties between India and Pakistan.

- An intelligence-based midnight operation was conducted by Coast Guard ships and aircraft to intercept the suspected fishing boat.

- The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) was reportedly tracking the boat right after it left Karachi. NTRO later notified the Coast Guard about the boat, after which it was tracked down using a Dornier aircraft.

- DNA reports that ""a Coast Guard Dornier aircraft undertook sea-air coordinated search and located the suspect fishing boat. Thereafter, the Coast Guard ship on patrol in the area was diverted and intercepted the unlit boat at about midnight of 31 December""

- The intercept took place following a precise intelligence-based, Coast Guard Inspector General (Operations) KR Nautiyal said.

- The Defence Ministry said the Coast Guard ship warned the fishing boat to stop for further investigation of the crew and cargo. However, the boat increased its speed and tried to escape from the Indian side of the maritime boundary.

- The hot pursuit continued for nearly one hour and the Coast Guard ship managed to stop the fishing boat after firing warning shots.

- Four persons were seen on the boat who disregarded all warnings by the Coast Guard ship to stop and cooperate with investigations.

- According to the Ministry of Defence, ""Soon thereafter, the crew hid themselves in the deck below and set the boat on fire, which resulted in an explosion and major fire on the boat.""

- Due to darkness, bad weather and strong winds, the boat and persons on board could not be saved or recovered. The boat burnt and sank in the same position, in the early hours of 1 January.

- While there has been speculation that this could have been a aborted fidayeen attack, DNA also quoted a senior intelligence official as saying, ""If it really was a boat carrying terrorists for a 26/11 kind of an attack, its crew would have attacked the Coast Guard ship first and blown up the boat only after harming the Coast Guard.""

- Meanwhile, an Indian Express report said, ""new evidence has begun to emerge that those on board might have been small-time liquor and diesel smugglers, ferrying bootleg cargo from the port of Gwadar to other fishing boats which were to have carried it into Karachi's Keti Bandar harbour.""

- Even as the incident saw much shock and speculation in India, Pakistan vehemently denied that the boat was carrying terrorists. Pakistani Foreign Office Spokesman Tasnim Aslam categorically denied the reports and told the media that no boat from Karachi had gone to the open seas. Pakistan's Defence Ministry officials also rejected the reports and said the Indians were ""trying to divert attention"" from the killing of two Pakistan Rangers on 31 December. ""It is part of Indian propaganda to tarnish the image of Pakistan,"" a Defence Ministry official told PTI.

- On Friday, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said, ""I congratulate the Coast Guard for the timely action of intercepting a boat carrying suspected terror groups with surgical precision, thereby eliminating danger.""

- However, according to DNA, intelligence officers are still wondering why the boat was chased. It reports that, ""According to UN convention, a nation can chase or intercept suspicious vessels if they prohibit the passage of the host nation's passage or if they (suspicious vessels) loiter above or under the surface of the sea. That was not the case here, officials say.""

- While neither Gujarat or Maharashtra police were informed about any intelligence report about any boat along the coast being watched, a senior Gujarat police official told Indian Express, ""You don't need to be a genius to figure out we should have been told, because, if the fishing boat was actually carrying explosives and managed to evade patrols on the seas, we should have been in position waiting for it.""

- As speculation mounts on whether this was actually a terror attack or not, Indian Express said three naval officers had told the newspaper, ""it was inconceivable that Pakistani fishing boats -typically four-crew vessels, with an average length of less than 25 metres and equipped with 80-220 horsepower diesel engines, or smaller mechanised sailboats with 30 horsepower engines - could outrun the Coast Guard's state-of-the-art ships.""",Non-Political,False,0.53,"[""It's a matter of what you choose to believe in.

Graham Stuart Staines (1941 – 22 January 1999) was an Australian Christian missionary who, along with his two sons Philip (aged 10) and Timothy (aged 6), was burnt to death by a gang while sleeping in his station wagon at Manoharpur village in Keonjhar district in Odisha, India on 22 January 1999. In 2003, a Bajrang Dal activist, Dara Singh, was convicted of leading the gang that murdered Graham Staines and his sons, and was sentenced to life in prison.

He had been working in Odisha among the tribal poor and lepers since 1965. Some Hindu groups alleged that Staines had forcibly converted or lured many Hindus into Christianity; Staines' widow Gladys denied these allegations. She continued to live in India caring for leprosy patients until she returned to Australia in 2004.

Advance disclaimer: I have absolutely no sources or no proof for any of this. This is purely speculation from my side. Take it as you may.

1. Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement was sponsored and supported with the objective of causing an Arab Spring type revolution in India which would take the incumbent government and existing systems out of play. This was the first step.

2. The next step was for the power vacuum to be filled by Arvind Kejriwal and his yet to be created party.

3. The third step was for AK's disruptive government/party to break-up India in the name of decentralization and mobocratic anti-corruption. Like many leftist revolutionaries, these guys are all set to dismantle all of the existing power structures and systems in India under the excuse of their being corrupt. This is how they plan to weaken and break up India.

4. The fourth step was for any and all types of foreign powers and groups to carve up the weak and broken India as they pleased over the next few years / decades.

Fortunately for us, the first step didn't turn into an Arab Spring-like revolution. Nevertheless, the second step of the plan went ahead and AK floated a party which is trying to take the top spot.

Fortunately for us and unfortunately for them, the top spot didn't become a vacuum, nor did they turn out to be the default choice to fill it. Instead, the default choice at the moment appears to be BJP and Modi. Thus, AK's and AAP's top priority is now to bring down Modi.

   1) You completely support it

Response to all the intolerance deniers in India,0.0,45y4bp,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/45y4bp/response_to_all_the_intolerance_deniers_in_india/,19.0,"Ok, I had enough of this intolerance debate, like most of you, but not in the way you think. Let me define the two sides in this debate first. I am on the side of the so called ‘intellectuals’, ‘liberals’, or ‘pseudo secularists’, and the ‘other side’ that I’ll refer to below is the people who are of the opinion that this intolerance talk is a bunch of politically motivated crap and everyone doing it has a political agenda, OR…(drumbeat).. is an ‘anti national’! One thing we’ll all agree on, I believe is there is a lot of intolerance on the conversation about intolerance

For the intolerance deniers, if you really don’t think sentiments have been changing in the past few years, then you definitely are not reading anything online. Just take a look at the comments section (below) of any article that has any reference to Muslims, intolerance, or could be on any other topic but is just authored by a Muslim. The comments are so ‘colorful’ and ‘abusive’ against a certain community that there are more ‘special character’ letters being used than regular characters, and almost universally all the dirty expletives are being uttered by Hindus (or Whites/Christian Majority nations) against Muslims. 

The level that our dear Indians have stooped to, in online conversation, is beyond what the rest of the world has done and the conversations start and end with disgusting ‘maa behen’ language against a certain community. Just based on religion, without knowing who the person is, or what their views are. The anonymity that the online world provides is exposing the true mindset of the majority community in India, and in many other nations as well. Let’s focus on India though, as the reasons for Muslim hatred vary a bit based on the country. The majority will say that the Muslim hatred in rooted in them being the source/cause of terrorism, support our neighbouring country, give importance only to their religion, or they are against our country. Seriously? That is very similar to saying that all blacks (say in USA) are criminals and drug dealers, or all Tamils are terrorists (as they sympathized with LTTE), or all Biharis in Mumbai are paanwallas. Judging a whole community because of a few bad elements in it is as horrible a crime as can be. After 9/11, many Americans thought anyone with a brown skin is an Arab and a terrorist. Do we really want to stoop so low in our thinking? Can’t we differentiate between innocent women and children being killed in Gujarat (even if they are Muslims) vs. the real extremists (such as ISIS) being killed? Aren’t Hindus known to be the inheritors of the Ram Rajya of ‘dharma’ and justice, who will never punish an innocent person? A true believer of Dharma will never allow the killing of an innocent person to go unpunished, no matter what religion the person belongs to. 

This is a good Segway to the first talking point of the so-called hypocrisy that the other side accuses the ‘intellectuals’ of. We only raise a hue and cry when Muslims are affected, but not when Hindus are affected. For example, did the media make a big issue of the Kashmiri Pundits being kicked out of Kashmir? (You can almost see their heads nodding arrogantly on reading this). That is the typical hogwash that they emit to try to convince themselves about how wrong the other side is. The thinking and principles of the ‘intellectuals’ is crystal clear..we will oppose anybody who harms an innocent person. This means we will strongly oppose animals like ISIS members, the killers of the Bangladeshi Bloggers, 26/11 Terrorists, Godhra train killers, AND the killers of innocent people in the Godhra riots, killers of Sikhs in 1984, killers of an innocent person in Dadri, and killers of an innocent write in Karnataka who spoke about intolerance. 

All these are grave crimes that cannot go unpunished. Justice should see no distinction and take no sides.  We are the ones opposing ALL forms of injustice, whereas the only response you guys have when asked about an innocent minority person being killed is ‘Why are not talking about Kashmiri Pundits’?,  or something of that sort. We are NOT the hypocrites, YOU are! Case CLOSED, and hypocrisy EXPOSED! There is no explanation that you can give to justify that reaction. An innocent person being killed should be condemned. Period. The fact the you guys are trying to avoid or cover up or distract from the topic of innocent killings shows that you actually condone it, and that is a result of the hatred in your mind. There is no other explanation, so stick your response you’re forming in your mind, in your ‘ear’!

When Aamir Khan highlighted atrocities against Dalits and women in Satyamev Jayate, he was given an award by the NCSC in 2012! The same person when he highlights atrocities against Muslims, is suddenly ‘anti-national’? People talking about the nation’s capital being the ‘rape capital’ of the country are not damaging the reputation of the country, but when Aamir mentions he’s alarmed about some recent kilings the country he is ‘destroying’ the reputation of the country? Amartya Sen, Raghuram Rajan, Vishal Dadlani and numerous other hindus have also spoken out about intolerance, but there are no protests against them and no stones being thrown at their houses and cars! Moreover, it was Kiran Rao who (allegedly) made the comments, but the protests are only against Aamir Khan? That is unquestionable evidence of the hypocrisy of the ‘other side’ (many of them BJP supporters), and there is nothing you can say which can explain it away. 

Hinduism used to be associated with the best qualities – tolerance, peace, kindness, non-violence, intellectual pursuits, karma, dharma etc. etc. – and it used to have ideals that many people looked up to and aspired to emulate. I am infuriated that all these qualities are slowly being extinguished by the current mindset in India, and all these so called ‘Indians’ are destroying the image of Hinduism due to the depraved, communal, and inhuman mindset they are displaying in this whole debate.  Now, these swarms of ‘educated’ Indians who only spew anger and venom, and label anyone highlighting abhorrent incidents or differing views an ‘anti national’ and  ‘enemy of the state’. 

These ‘differences’ existed for many years, but what has changed now? I remember ShahRukh Khan made a statement in 2010 about allowing Pakistani cricketers into India and Shivsena created a ruckus and blocked MNIK screenings. But that reaction was the only limited reaction in Mumbai, and most people opposed that action from Shiv Sena. Fast forward to 2015, and a brief mention about intolerance from SRK is enough to throw vile insults, ‘anti national’ barbs, stones at his home and car, and ban his movies! The difference is that people are now emboldened to openly vent and proudly display their hatred and communal feelings in the garb of ‘patriotism’, because the ruling government has made it acceptable and ‘patriotic’ to do so. It is the same as Muslim extremists crawling out from the ground in the middle east, after ISIS came up and put forth an ideology that extremists could justify as ‘pure ISLAM’ (yes, women salves can be justified by ISIS!)

Yes, I am intolerant too, and I don’t have any qualms to admitting it! I am intolerant to people who when asked about a murder of an innocent person respond with ‘well, why are you not asking about the innocent people who got killed xx years ago?’ I am intolerant about the person who when asked about 1000s of innocent Muslim deaths in 2002, gave the answer ‘Well, why are you not asking me about the 56 deaths in the train?’ Well, Mr. PM and supporters, who the eff says the 56 deaths is not a heinous crime in itself? We do see the culprits of that crime being prosecuted though, whereas the response for the 1000s of other innocent deaths is either ‘well, if certain people cross their limits then they have to be taught a lesson’ at worst or  ‘well, it is tough to control angry mobs, and the other side is to blame for inflaming them in the first place’ at best!

I am sure that the people on the other side of this debate are grinding their teeth in anger and foaming at the mouth right now, for if there is one thing they cannot ‘tolerate’ it is somebody telling them they are wrong! I also know that this will not even change one person’s mind on the other side, for the opinions and hatred are so strongly formed in their thick skulls that you cannot penetrate it with a nuke. The only reason why I’m sending this is to rally the few individuals who are on my side and who are the saving grace of the country. We need to come together and mount a massive david vs goliath campaign against these destroyers of Indian democracy and Hinduism, because we are not going to back down on this war. This is bigger than the battle for independence of the country, and like we shuttled the brits out at that time we’ll make sure we’ll rid the nation of this poisonous mindset. Looking forward to the next round in this debate..do forward it if you want to respond or want this debate to continue..

I am a Muslim and I don\'t mind if your answers criticize Indian Muslims\' behavior and actions as long as they are logical and unnecessarily harsh and anti-islamic. So please, answer honestly.\n\nIt\'s not just simply what happened centuries ago, I think there are many geo political factors even with relation to the recent history. I believe in present day India post partition of Colonial India based on religion and the riots that took place scarred both India and Pakistan.\n\nPakistan was built on Islamic values while India took birth as Democratic secular country, there is no doubt that culturally Hinduism and Islam have differences but post partition even though Islam and Hinduism were at odds and a lot of Hindus did hated the idea of Islam they were still by and large tolerant of Muslims.\n\nPakistan on the other hand post independence took a very different route, in 1971 Pakistan was split into two parts and for the first time atrocities against Hindus by west Pakistan came to light. While current day Bangladeshi Muslims at that time never supported the same, but this was the first time where the Hindu Extremism was taking roots.\n\n>The first report of the Bangladesh genocide was published by West Pakistani journalist [Anthony Mascarenhas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mascarenhas) in *The Sunday Times*, London on 13 June 1971 titled ""Genocide"". He wrote: ""I saw Hindus, hunted from village to village and door to door, shot off-hand after a cursory \'short-arm inspection\' showed they were uncircumcised. I have heard the screams of men bludgeoned to death in the compound of the Circuit House (civil administrative headquarters) in Comilla. I have seen truckloads of other human targets and those who had the humanity to try to help them hauled off \'for disposal\' under the cover of darkness and curfew.""[\\[69\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide#cite_note-69) This article helped turn world opinion against Pakistan and decisively encouraged the Government of India to intervene.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide#cite_note-:0-1) On 2 August 1971, *Time* magazine correspondent sent a dispatch that provided detailed description of the destruction in East Pakistan.\n\nI don\'t think Indians hated Muslims but they were still against the idea of Islam. During 1970\'s the Hindu minorities now in Pakistan took even more Hits, a lot of Indian politicians were extremely short sighted and would rarely address such issues raised by Hindus on international or even national stages. Most of them being shunned as not responsibility of India. This was fodder to Hindu extremism which started creating a narrative by the time, that Hinduism is in a grave danger from Islam.\n\nShah Bano case and then in a country with Hindu Majority exodus of Kashmiri Pandits ( 1989 )  in their own land at the hands of Islamic extremists were the final nail in the coffins. While Kashmiri Pandits were by and large ignored by popular media at that time they were used extensively as a showcase of Islamic extremism and Hindu persecution. This had nothing to do with Indian Muslims, but nevertheless Islam was a binding factor in all of it.\n\nOur politician mishandled an extremely delicate situation, I think it was around early 1990\'s where Hindu extremism took the final form and gained mainstream attention. Then came Babri Masjid followed by riots in 1992 / 2002 by Hindu extremists, Series of  Bomb Blasts by radical Islamic organisation in decades to come.\n\nPost 9 / 11, even in western countries hate for Islam increased, the increase in hate crimes against Muslims in west are increasing by double digits every single year. In past 2 decades Islam got a major problem with Global image. There is indeed a dislike for Islam that is rising globally. I am not sure if it has contributed to the hate for Muslims, but I can safely say that it has definitely been a negative.\n\nWhile you club it with Hindu\'s hate but the hate or dislike for Islam is in every religion prevalent in India be it Sikhism, Buddhism or Jainism. It is now shaping up to be a fight between Indian culture which BJP paints as Hindu Culture vs Islam.\n\nIndian Muslims by and large never did anything to warrant such hate, on the other hand no matter how much we want white wash it, Extreme Islamic radicalisation or use of Islam in politics have been a big problem. It\'s not just even Hindus, even within Muslim community particularly  Ahmadiyya to an extent have started hating Muslims ( Sunni ) . Unfortunately the Wahhabi version of Islam is on rise, Hindus in India don\'t understand the nuances and different sects of Islam. Hindu extremism is on rise but even now it\'s not a very huge number. Hindus are in majority ( about 1 billion of them ) even 0.5% of Hindus if they become extremist would lead to huge riots. Radicalisation of Hindus was a long process, while a lot of Hindus believed in culturally backward practices and were mentally not open to idea of Islam but they  never acted on them in this scale.\n\nI don\'t believe it\'s as simple as many of us here would like to say , that Hindus hate Islam / Muslims or may be the fact that hate harboured and during Mughal rule that transitioned to modern India.\n\nEven my opinion is cane a very small part of multitudes of reasons. It\'s definitely not simple. I think we should stop reducing such complex social issues to simple reasons.The main idea is that Hating Muslims is wrong , hating Hindus is equally wrong. These debates have no ends but India as a nation has a lot more to address than religion.', 'Disclaimer: I am not a bhakt.\n\nIslam is very intolerant to other religions or to even other sects of the same religion (ask Shias, Ahmadis or Alawites). It is mostly incompatible with modern society or culture. Even the most advanced Islamic countries like Turkey or Malaysia are not progressive or democratic enough.\n\nSo, I think it will be difficult for people from other religions to like Islam and its followers.']",False,False,False,False,False,True

As far as the whole ""BJP is antimuslim"" rhetoric, lets face it- it is bullshit.

I have read several good reasons as to why Kashmir should not be separated. But all those reasons have been from a practical/strategic point of view. My question is from the aspect of morality. If the people of Kashmir do not want to be a part of India, under what moral authority do we still consider them Indian? Not so long ago, we as Indians were in a similar position with respect to the British. Why is it so difficult to look at the situation from the perspective of an ordinary Kashmiri ? ",AskIndia,False,0.49,"['Do they have the moral right to demand separation after they kicked a major chunk of the population out of the valley?', ""Apply your logic to Kashmiris themselves. Do the kashmiri pandits want to live with kashmiri muslims? Do the shias want to live with sunnis (in Kashmir). Do the buddhists want to live with the rest. What are you going to do? Split kashmir into 10 parts and give everyone their own? The reality is Kashmir is too small to be independent surrounded by 3 nuclear powers so it going to get influenced by all of them. Where would you rather have the Kashmiris go? China, Pakistan or India.\n\nI submit that is it India's MORAL OBLIGATION to make sure kashmir doesn't end up with Pakistan or China and suffer like minorities do in those countries. If India leaves Kashmir to themselves they will get eaten alive by Pakistanis or Chinese. "", ""I don't think India's sovereignty over Kashmir can be defended only on a strict moral basis but a combination of realist and normative arguments can indeed be given.\n\nTechnically if you have got a piece of land and you can defend it from occupation by others through threat of war or through meticulous alliances, then that land belongs to you. There is nothing wrong about it. That's how most countries came about as they did. India right now has sovereignty over Kashmir. It is challenged by some elements both from inside and outside but if India can protect it against them then her sovereignty over Kashmir remains intact. No reason needs to be given other than the ability and the inclination of the state to protect it's sovereignty. India doesn't owe any explanation to any country as what she is doing is just what a country in a nation-state system is supposed to do. Of course this hard power can always be augmented with softer narratives and India does have those too.\n\nHas India economically exploited Kashmir? By exploitation i mean stealing the material wealth of Kashmir. This question is important because it has the potential to distinguish 'Indian imperialism' from British colonialism. Remember British defended their colonialism through all sorts of ideologies (White man's burden) but beneath these layers of ideologies was their fundamental propensity to exploit other countries economically. British rule over India was based on this exploitative relation. British rule over India was a net economic burden as shown in many studies some of these speculation appearing as early as 1857 revolution which later studies only confirmed. It is my understanding that India has not stolen the material wealth of Kashmir. To give you an example India spends more on Kashmir than it collects through taxes. If anything from a pure economic perspective India's relationship with Kashmir has been mutually beneficial. \n\nAll moral rights over others are ultimately rooted in our fair conduct. No one but the Father has the greatest and unquestionable moral right over the affairs of his juvenile children but he too loses it if he is found unnecessarily beating his kids. Moral legitimacy can not be derived from any static source other than fair conduct, a concern for subject's welfare and the conformity that it may produce. All other static moral claims be it based on common culture, common language, common descent or common religion needs to be substantiated with fair conduct as the case of former East Pakistan shows. Argue from which way you may, Kashmiris today are ruled by representatives which are chosen by them in a free and fair election. They enjoy a constitution of unprecedented liberality. This fact alone puts Kashmiris ahead of 2.5 billion others who live under authoritarian regimes with no choice of their own. \n\nBritish rule over India was fundamentally racist not because Britishers were from other race but because they perpetually maintained cultural superiority of empire over her subjects. In contrast Indian rule is egalitarian and inclusive to the extent that India has never tried to deliberately subvert or condescend Kashmiri culture or language and she only desires a mutual syncretism which may benefit both.\n\nNone of this is meant to say that Kashmiris don't have right to feel the way they feel. But equating Indian rule with British colonialism is unfair towards India and the effort she has put to keep all together for selfless reasons. Indian state rules only over the lands of her various people not over their minds and neither she desires to do so. Some Kashmiris do feel deep alienation and the enmity that it may bring but those too can be quelled through right remedies. The feeling of alienation can be productively sublimated in to cultural artifacts or it can be used towards social services.

Modi - who is he? Hear me out.,0.0,1g426c,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1g426c/modi_who_is_he_hear_me_out/,15.0,"So what's his story? 

He probably was lucky to be a CM of a state where one fine day crazy Mullahs decided to burn a train. Burnt train incident snowballed into a huge riot. Swords were drawn, blood was spilled, lives were taken, and houses, societies, properties were burnt. What happened afterwards?

Riots were manipulated, ideas were sold, people were bought and polarized. Muslims were sent to ghettos and Hindus were told to jerk off and celebrate a revenge they finally took on centuries old Islamic atrocities. 

Modi was a CM, even if he wasn't directly involved, he is held responsible for whatever happened. It wouldn't have been difficult for him to immediately arrest people involved in train burning incident and prosecute them. The chootiya low level leaders probably on the behest of high level of BJP went on a rampage, literally killed the centuries old society and Bhaichara among people. You know what astonishes me the most about these rioters - these motherfuckers didn't go and single out the perpetrators of Godhra crime but they went in and raped and slashed wombs of hapless women and children. 

BJP won again in Gujarat but lost in center because of this one derailed Godhra incident. Why did MODI won in Gujarat, definitely not because of DEVELOPMENT. In one year from GODHRA incident and riots, only DEVELOPMENT he probably brought to people of Gujarat was a burnt train, parked in a yard, and an empty, burnt, and broken Gulbarg Society. My fellow brothers and sister here don't understand that he was voted to power again by Hindu brethren because he was their hope to avoid the law for the crimes that this brethren has perpetrated. 

Fast forward to today, doesn't matter how much development you bring in, how much money you feed in to that 2 year old infant who lost his world forever that fucking day when his mother was raped and dad was burnt alive. No amount of world's riches can bring his life back. So fellow brethren, Modi came back to Power not because he brought the development but because of vested interests. Evil triumphed over truth. 

Modi came to power and surprisingly BJP lost at the center because what BJP was trying to master, congress had already mastered. They know how to topple BJP in the game that they have mastered many years ago, that is polarize people, divide them on lines of caste, religion etc. On similar lines Indira and Congress won in 1984. Because of Muslims now MODI won in 2002. Thank god that rest of India didn't get played out in 2004 and voted NDA out of power. Otherwise we might have had a different day here today. However, what BJP could have done by retaining power in 2004, congress did exactly that, that is fucked us Indians over and out. 

Fast forward to preparing for 2009 general elections and eventually losing the elections. BJP noticed the electorate success MODI has enjoyed in Gujarat, at the same time saw Advani no more than a piece of old shit. They desperately needed funding and a mass leader who would propel BJP to new heights. MODI was the answer to all their troubles and questions. I don't know how much money was spent on MODI propaganda. In few years he has become a larger than life figure. Honestly he is an average orator. His voice is not clear, his English sucks, and he really does twist the facts. 

In my eyes MODI is not the answer for us Indians, someone like Kejriwal is. He is one of us and we can prove our democracy only by electing a leader who is one of us.

That being said, why the fuck BJP now pretending that they care for Advani? Why can't their spokesperson go upfront in public and tell that Advani is an idiot and they have laid him off?

"People who oppose beef ban, would you eat a human being ? (more explanation inside, long post)",0.0,3q0x25,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3q0x25/people_who_oppose_beef_ban_would_you_eat_a_human/,102.0,"People who say that we should be free to eat whatever we like, let's say that government allows eating meat of humans that are raised like livestock, people whose mental abilities are below an average human, people who have been raised like livestock since the day they were born. This is a purely hypothetical situation and you can argue that this would never happen. But if it did, would you eat human meat that was advertised in such a way that it made you think more about how delicious it would be as opposed to how it was raised or killed for that matter. 

Please remember that I've nothing against people who oppose meat ban. It's just that I normally see argument against beef ban supporters like, if you want to ban eating beef, why not meat and chicken too ? And if you're banning meat, why not ban eating plants too, as they are living beings and they can feel to ? I've no argument against this statement. 

You can say that even if the human I'm talking about is close to an animal, it would still feel the same feelings that we do, albeit crudely. Also, you can say that it would be difficult to watch something that looks so much like a human, to be killed right in front of your eyes in shops that sell fresh meat. 

You might not agree with this, but I think cows and humans or other animals feel the same basic feelings. I personally think that although humans have a really advanced brain, they can do things that animals might never be able to. Also, we can ask questions about ourselves, our existence, we have free will. I'm sorry if I missed any other important things that we humans can do. But I think, at the end it all boils down to eating, sleeping, sex, excretion and other basic processes. Of course this is a really stupid generalization as I am basically summarising the entire heap of human achievements in a mere one line. 

I personally think that we should be free to eat whatever we like, because we basically rule the world. When I say we rule the world, I mean that we are the most dominant race out of all living beings. You can argue that, deadly virus or bacteria would be a good candidate too, so let's say that we are one of the most powerful races of living beings. Even if people argue that eating beef, or meat is morally wrong, what is right and what is wrong is subjective. So, eating beef or meat is a choice of the individual. 

Some world governments have declared some species as protected and you cannot kill them because they are on verge of extinction and they are important part of the food pyramid. Wiping them out of the face of Earth would been disruption in the food chain and other effects on the environment. So, basically you cannot kill some species even if they are pretty dangerous to deal with like, tigers, lions and other carnivore animals. Their numbers are pretty small in size, so they can't do much anyway, although there are exceptions like tigers attacking tribal people living in the area. 

This further reaffirms the fact that we humans can do whatever we want. Since cows, pigs and other livestock are available in abundance, there won't be any environmental impact and we can kill as many as we want. But, what would we do if there was a hypothetical situation where humans that I described before were a part of livestock too ? Would we eat them too ? What would happen if someday the livestock we've been killing since thousands of years turn intelligent and do the same thing to us ? What would be our thoughts when another dominant race comes in and starts killing us for food and we can't do anything about it ? Would our feelings be the same as the thousands of cows, pigs and chickens we kill everyday for food ? Would we feel the same way on the verge of death as those animals do ? A lot of these situations are pretty hypothetical and stupid what-if situations which might never happen. But the purpose of these questions was to know what you think.

I'm very sorry if this question is offensive to you. I had this questions bugging me since quite some time and I wanted to know your opinion or thoughts. If anything I said sounds stupid, please excuse my stupidity. I think I might be biased at some points, so please take what I wrote with a grain of salt. And thank you for reading this wall of text.

I think the Pokhran nuclear tests were the biggest foreign policy blunder India ever made.

So please read to the end, I promise it will be worth it.

To start off, India is in a shitty situation wrt Pakistan. One of the main reasons is, we are in a position where we cannot use our vast superiority in conventional weapons/military. It is very dangerous and almost impossible to have a limited scope conventional battle between 2 nuclear powers.
It is very easy for it to escalate into a nuclear war.

For people who want a lot more detailed version of this post, take a look at this MIT lecuture on India-Pakistan clusterfuck. Start at 35mins if you want to skip details about nuclear weapons in general
http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-8-004-reducing-the-danger-of-nuclear-weapons-and-proliferation-january-iap-2015/videos/lecture-1-south-asia-under-the-shadow-of-nuclear-weapons/

This is one of the most unbiased sources you will find. It is given by an Indian/ABCD prof Vipin and you will see that it is relatively unbiased. No professor, TV channel in India will have the balls to look at things this objectively.

1971 war was pretty bad on Pakistan and they were not ready to lose a conventional battle to India again. Indira Gandhi tested a nuclear device, which is technically not a bomb, was dubbed as nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes. World bought it to a certain extent except Pakistan, 
where the famous words ""we will eat grass, but we will get nuclear weapons too"". But ours was not a bomb. It was a bulky, almost 2x the size of a car, which could never be mounted on a plane/missile.

Then Narasimha Rao's government was very close to testing the weapon and declaring India as a nuclear state. Till then India was not a official nuclear state so the world was unsure. Thanks to pressure from US, they did not test it.

Enter BJP, they even had it in their manifesto that they will test it. They made it an issue of national pride, almost saying the congress govt was afraid of the 'west'. This issue became a big deal, got politicized and was made a matter of nationalism and the leaders did not really grasp the scale of what they were talking about.
Basically doing anything to win the election.

Then comes the test in 1998 tests. India proudly announced to the world effectively that they were a nuclear state. Nationalism and chest thumping everywhere. 2 weeks later Pakistan did it too. This changed the equation between India and Pakistan forever.

Why?
It is almost like Pakistan was baiting India. Both countries had been working on the weapons since the 1970s test and were waiting for each other to test it. Because the country that tests first will face the international ire, sanctions and second country gets to say ""they did it.we are doing it for self defense""
I am sure Pakistan was hoping India would test it, because once India tests and makes it legitimate that they are a nuclear country, Pakistan can do it too and announce they are a nuclear country too. This erased India's conventional military superiority advantage overnight.
All because some retarded overly nationalistic leaders put it in their manifesto.

What could India have done? It could have developed it, kept the world guessing if it had the weapons. Unofficially all countries knew India had the weapons and yes, China would not have messed with India because even though India say they dont have it, China knows India does. They would not have taken that chance.
How does it help with Pakistan? Because both sides are publicly saying they dont have nuclear weapons, say India wanted to enter pakistan and destroy a few terror camps. India could have used its conventional army and done that. Its like 2 card players hiding their best cards and holding on to it, bluffing that they dont have it while both sides know they do.
India folded first and showed its cards. India could always use its conventional army for limited scale objective missions. Pakistan would be in a position where they cannot use their weapons unless India went all in, trying to invade all the way to Islamabad, then all bets were off.

Now, Pakistan says ""any missile fired from Indian side, we automatically assume that it is a nuclear weapon and will respond with a nuclear weapon.""

Because they are technically right. India is a self certified nuclear state and they cant risk a single missile landing there, wait for it to explode and see if that was 
a nuclear weapon and then respond. So now, even a single missile fired towards paksitan will get a nuclear response from them and so India's hands are tied.

Pakistan knows this and started testing India's patience. Kargil in 2001, Parliament attack in 2002 and several others all the way to Mumbai. It is no coincidence that attacks from Pakistan suddenly increased after 2000. Pakistan must have been laughing loudly when these happened because we could not do squat. Why? we both legitimized our nuclear weapons and our conventional army is tied up. 
If we had maintained we did not, but developed it secretly and kept it, it would have left them guessing. An attack happens on the parliament? retaliate with conventional army. Nuclear? what nuclear? we keep saying ""we dont have nuclear weapons"" and continue with conventional battle. Pakistan cant use their nuclear weapons too.
But in our present case, one Indian army bomber crosses into Pakistan, all they need to do is ""their bomber is here to drop nuclear weapons, we cant wait and see what it is. we retaliate""

BJP's over nationalism basically fucked up the situation.

Same happening all over again with Balochistan. That was our trump card. Entire world knows we are involved there but we kept denying it as no official announced that we are. Pakistan just kept crying that we are and world did not know what to do. Who were we kidding when we built 6 ""embassies"" in afghnistan. Why do we need that many there?
We are second biggest donors for Afghanistan after US. Whole world knows whats happening and they kept quiet and Pakistan was the only one complaining. Then comes Modi announcing it to the world, to make his supporters at home feel like we are actually doing something when the govt is getting humiliated in Kashmir.
What changed now? Not a damn thing in Balochistan, we were involved before, will be involved in the future. The only difference is, now Pakistan has an official statement from our PM to point to, when any terror attack happens related to Balochistan. Pakistan-China economic corridor passes right through, China knew India 
was involved in derailing attempts, now our great PM made it official. China now is openly saying ""India is derailing our economic projects there. Your PM just said it!"" We have effectively legitimized their support of terror in Kashmir because our PM openly said we are supporting inside their country! I just cannot believe what a reckless move that was 

I am scared at what this blind nationalism will lead to. BJP is a different kind of poison.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I AM NOT SAYING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DEVELOPED NUKES. ITS  A GREAT THING WE DID. EVEN IF WE HAD NOT ANNOUNCED IT, THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW IT. CHINA WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO CHECK IF WE DID BECAUSE WE HAD ALREADY TESTED IT IN THE 70s.",Politics,False,0.59,"['> World bought it to a certain extent except Pakistan, where the famous words ""we will eat grass, but we will get nuclear weapons too""\n\nYou have it backwards. Bhutto had already embarked on a nuke program to prevent Bangladesh - II. \n\nThe biggest foreign policy blunder was handing over the 90,000 PoWs and taking Bhutto\'s word at Shimla. ', 'While I like the thought put in your analysis, I disagree with it. There are several flaws. \n\n>What could India have done? It could have developed it, kept the world guessing if it had the weapons. \n\nNuclear weapons in a complex technology. without testing, it is very hard to know whether you have any effective deterrence on not. Do you know how many times USA tested their weapons? Of every design, every yield class, from every platform, on land, in water, in air? A deterrence works only when it is credible. \n\n>Nuclear? what nuclear? we keep saying ""we dont have nuclear weapons"" and continue with conventional battle. Pakistan cant use their nuclear weapons too.\n\nWhy not? What would stop them then that won\'t stop them now? If they go nuclear the consequences from India and the world will be the same. It\'s immaterial if they first declared themselves a nuclear state or not. \n\nWhat changed in Balochistan? Well, their movement just got mainstreamed riding India\'s soft power. Nothing changed among the intelligence community. They all mostly know what the others know. \n\n>We have effectively legitimized their support of terror in Kashmir because our PM openly said we are supporting inside their country! \n\nLegitimized? Were they waiting for it before doing what they thought they could get away with? \n\nAt the end, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. What national interest have we secured in our independent history by not being ""BJP-styled nationalistic""? What has ""Pacifist on the outside but covertly schemy"" given us? When Baloch leaders were tortured, their people killed by hundreds of thousands, their resources sucked dry, did we stop anything? When countless Tamils got butchered (before LTTE went full crazy), could we stop it? Why does Bangladesh, a nation we helped create and didn\'t occupy or colonize in any way, sort of hate us? Why can\'t we stop theocracy in Maldives? Why doe Nepal hate us? \n\nYou criticize Modi\'s Baloch Policy, but Bangladesh and Afghanistan have already supported it. It can\'t be completely wrong. ', '> This is one of the most unbiased sources you will find.\n\nThere are no unbiased sources. Neither you nor me can ever be unbiased. Stop looking for ""unbiased opinions"", opinions have biases built inside them. Just to give an example, your post seems to have a bias against the BJP and the concept of nationalism. (Just to make a point not to start a fight.)\n\n**I will only address some issues about the nuclear weapons testing decision**\n\n1. Bhutto had been lobbying Ayub and Yahya to make a nuclear weapon long before India ever tested. He foresaw that after our defeat at the hands of the Chinese we will go nuclear. He was right. Consequently as soon as he came to power he set about righting this imbalance. *He did not wait for Smiling Buddha to start the Pak Nuclear program.*\n\n2. Secondly, **pretty much no one bought into the idea of a _peaceful nuclear explosion_**. The Canadians were furious as we had used the [CANDU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor#Foreign_sales) reactor to enrich Uranium. They imposed [sanction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiling_Buddha#Canada_and_United_States) on us that were lifted only recently. It was in reaction to this explosion that NSG and other nuclear bodies were set up. So, our isolation had already begun as opposed to your argument that we were isolated after Pokhran-II.\n\n3. All governments expected to be sanctioned for the test. The Rao government did not do it probably because India was going though an economic crisis. But they nonetheless supported more research in the area. Please understand that nuclear explosions are very carefully planned events. The BJP simply cannot come into power and order a test to be performed. If the institutions in the government advise against such a test then Vajpayee simply cannot change that. It was a decision that was made after years of deliberation and planning, not at the spur of a moment. Also, can you give a source for your statement that BJP had promised a nuke test in election manifesto? Seems like a strange thing for the opposition party to say when the government is claiming we do not have nukes. (Though this is a tangential point to my argument, I don\'t mind being wrong here.) There was no nationalistic component in the decision making process. After the explosion the BJP sought to reap the rewards. Even Congress would have done the same. They are after all, politicians.\n\n4. India absolutely needed to test the bomb. Why? Because we could not be sure of the design without it. By your own admission our first device was very bulky, so we needed to miniaturize it. We could not have relied on simulations forever to test out our new design. Even now, while we claim to have the fusion bomb there is no guarantee because our test was a dud. I am sure scientists are working to improve the design and are doing simulations, but there is no guarantee until we can test it out. Also, note that **Pakistan had already validated their designs with China\'s help during the [Lop Nor Tests in 1990](https://youtu.be/ndKEB5VYff0?t=3338).** India had to validate it\'s design otherwise we could never be sure if our bomb would work when we needed it the most.\n\n**Regarding Pakistani Nuclear Doctrine:**\n\n>Now, Pakistan says ""any missile fired from Indian side, we automatically assume that it is a nuclear weapon and will respond with a nuclear weapon.""\n\nOP, you are dead wrong about this. You seem to have absolutely no understanding about Pakistan\'s nuclear doctrine. Pakistani leaders have repeatedly made it clear that they will not wait for a launch from India. They will launch preemptively. You make some points about how India\'s conventional superiority was wiped out by this test. You are wrong. India\'s superiority was wiped out long back. Even in the late 80\'s Pak leaders were saying: ""What we have does not matter. *What they think we have is what matters.*"" Meaning, **Pakistani generals were actually using the cover of uncertainty to deter India.** The same uncertainty that you propose India should have used to it\'s benefit was used IRL by Pakistan. Combine this with the fact that Lop Nur test happened in 1986 you can see that we were not assured of an easy quick victory any more by the early 90s.\n\n> What could India have done? It could have developed it, kept the world guessing if it had the weapons.\n\nYou claim that various acts of terror could not have been perpetrated by them if they were not sure that we had the nukes. You are making the assumption that like all sane nations Pakistan uses nukes as a deterrent against larger powers. Instead, it uses it as an **umbrella to perpetrate it\'s Jihad**. We had the worst of insurgency supported by Pakistan during the 90\'s right? So clearly, Pakistan was not deterred by the nuclear uncertainty that you advocate here. Which means that incidents like Mumbai, Parliament attack etc. would have happened anyway (I blame those more on intelligence failures). \n\nThis uncertainty however does not work in our favor, mainly because our posture is defensive. It helps Pakistan that it appears to be an unstable country and it\'s actions cannot be guessed. Precisely because our generals could not be sure of what Pakistan had or how it will react to an limited offensive, they cannot plan for all contingencies and so we were deterred from taking any military action to punish them. How can we be sure that Pakistanis won\'t panic and fire the nuke which we *know* they have? How do we know what their threshold is if both of us claim we do not have the nukes? So there was no tangible benefit to us to keep our nukes secret. Keeping the nukes secret actually helped them and they could support an insurgency with impunity anyway. Indeed, keeping it a secret would actually harm India and there are benefits to declaring our nuclear capabilities, as I explain later.\n\nRegarding your points about a quick conventional war in case both nations did not show their hand. Pakistan has articulated its policy that if India were to ever (a) try to partition it again, (b) they were losing the conventional war badly or (c) India supports a covert insurgency or mass unrest that is looking like its about to succeed, they will use the nukes preemptively. So, IMO they were always going to use the nukes first, even if they publicly claimed they did not have them. As all Pakistanis generals claim, what is the use of having *it* if we are not going to use it?\n\n**Conclusion**: \n\nMy opinion is that by conducting these tests all nations now know us as a nuclear power. We have articulated a nuclear policy so all nations know our thresholds and the esclation path. They do not have to fear us irrationally. Do you remember an adverse affects of testing the Agni V or new SLBMs? Do you expect anyone to sanction us if we were to test the Agni VI? If we had not come clear, first it would have been difficult to justify why were developing such missiles and platforms and it would have definitely set alarm bells ringing everywhere.\n\nThe same is true for Pakistan. We know their policy and the escalation chain and so there is some predictability. IMO, if both nations had hid their weapons then we would both be investing in nuclear weapons and capabilities even more as we would not know what the other country is capable of. This would only feed more paranoia and mistrust into an already charged situation. For example, Pakistan just got tactical nukes and they have modified their doctrine even further, by adding that any rapid thrusts made by Indian military and they will nuke *even their own cities and people* to stop Indian Army. Can you imagine what their attitude and thinking would be if they knew that we had the nukes but weren\'t sure when we would use them? They would have to work under the assumption that we will use them preemptively too. This would make them even more paranoid and they will do something rash even at the slightest suspicion, quite like the scenario you present in your essay.\n\nBy coming out in the open we can actually have an honest discussion with all nations about our program and intentions which actually led to the nuclear accord and tacit acceptance of our nuclear program, the rewards of which we have started to reap. Without the test these talks could not have happened.\n\nEdit: Added some more thoughts in conclusion section.']",False,True,False,False,False,True

Mr Neeraj Thakur, Author of this stupidity, if you are here on reddit, please brush up your financial skills.\n\nThe reasons exports (and imports) have declined by $ dollar value so much  is because a significant portion of this is tied to commodity prices value (like crude, precious metals). When the underlying prices of these items have crashed by 50% over the last one year, of course the dollar value of these export items will crash significantly. \n\nAs an example, lets say India imports 10 barrels of oil, refines it and exports it back by adding 10% value to it. So when oil cost was at $120 per barrel, exports will be valued at 120 * 10 * 1.1= $1320.\nNext year with oil at $50, exports will be valued now at 50 * 10 *1.1 = $550. So now you see exports have crashed by 58% y/y. Woah dude. Makes an impressive headline, right Mr. Neeraj.\n\nAnother point made in the article was concern on rupee touching 2 year lows against the dollar. Its a valid claim that rupee has depreciated. However, if you view Rupee against of basket of currencies other than dollar, we have actually appreciated against them. See [this link](http://imgur.com/JytAcQ8) where I have done a crude comparision of INR vs major currencies. All except dollar have shown appreciation. **For the world economies, who are actively seeking depreciation for their currencies this year, India cannot afford to have a strong currency**. The game has simply changed over last 2 years. \n\nAlso, when NDA did criticize rupee performance INR was depreciating fast against all major currencies. This was bad news for investors who then had a better chance of keeping money out of India in any other major country to retain dollar value. See [this link](http://imgur.com/bjs88Bi). We were suffering from many issues then such as high CAD at that time. \n\nAlso guys, please watch this [Chandra Kochar interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odJnzO4jK9o) on Bloomberg which happened this week where she talks what has changed in Indian economy over the last 18 months in very simple and easy to understand sentences.\n', 'Ama mian, catchnews jaise useless clickbait mat post karo yaar.

[P] The Cult of Modi - understanding the rise of India-Purusha Narendra,6.0,5yx79w,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5yx79w/p_the_cult_of_modi_understanding_the_rise_of/,56.0,"Remember India is Indira, Indira is India? Modi, like a lot of his ideas, has borrowed and reinvented it into - support for Modi, is support for India. 

This is incredibly influential on you if you believe in it, and mindboggling if you don't - so, a classic cult. But politics in India has been like that for a long time, since Mahatma Gandhi, so let's not talk about that. But a few points on the appeal of the India-Purusha Narendra Modi - the man who is India, for his supporters. Why is his cult as it is?

I have three reasons.

One, genuine anti-incumbency. This is still a thing - look at Punjab, Goa, Delhi, et al. There is still huge negativity regarding how government functions, regardless of party, and generally people still vote against parties to show their frustration. 

Two, genuine solutions based politics. Now, India-Purusha's solutions are often seen as rudimentary and simplistic by those with higher proficiency in policy analysis. But that's not his target. Jaitley deals with that through his lawyerly dark arts. Modi offers simple, direct and immediate solutions to what we can call the 'nouveau literate' - segments of the citizenry which is newly literate, especially in IT, who can understand information from different sources, especially Social Media, but are still not proficient enough to dig deeper and do critical analysis. This allows India-Purusha to selectively feed information, and then provide simple solutions, emerging as the saviour/champion.

Three, consolidation of Hindu vote bank. For a long time Hindu votes have been fragmented by caste, India-Purusha has the genuine ability to unite Hindus despite caste. Now, most times, this is unity against Muslims, building on point one, using point two, but he is a genuine mass leader, like Indira, like Nehru.

This is a new era of politics, our old formulas don't work. The question is, is this a permanent change or the consequences of a single man's rise to power. Only time will tell. It's too soon anyway to talk of a post-Modi era, because India-Purusha is, right now, only beginning.

We must all get used to hearing Har Har Modi and Namo, Namo for a long time yet.

Edit: A clarification regarding the concept of 'nouveau literate' - I don't imply this to be a class specific category. It applies to two main sections of society - across caste, class, region etc. One, young voters, especially those who became politically active because of Modi from UPA's latter years.

I have this perception that MSM (mainstream media) has generally negative views of current central govt so for past one month, I have stopped following MSM and deactivated my Twitter account. On twitter there seems to be either a civil war b/w liberal/left/RW or lame jokes by stand up comedians.

The only thing I have been reading now is Business Standard which mostly maintains neutral standpoint since majority of the news is just market reports or/and policy framework of govt.

But here too, have been seeing loads of vomits of Modiji in foreign land and I swear to god, I'm getting sick to my stomach. [For instance look at this](http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/modi-promises-reforms-with-speed-and-boldness-115112100641_1.html)

* I dont understand why the fuck is he promising reforms with speed, why the fuck not sit your ass and do whatever the fuck is necessary. By giving a credit line of USD 1 billion, he thinks that he is statesman. Instead he sounds like a paid clown. China can just piss USD 10 billion like that. Why the fuck always compare yourself with China when you don't have much oxygen in your lungs.


* Madarchod, there has been hardly any motherfucking so-called reforms. Instead, budget of social welfare NAREGA has gone up. India has moved just 4 motherfuckin points in WEF' Ease of Doing Bussiness and this 4 point is because of improvement in power generation.

* There are plenty of low-hanging fruits for Mr. Modi which do not require parliament legislation. For starters he can sell sick PSUs like Air India/MTNL/HMT etc among others. But there has been only talks of their sale. Isn't minimum govt means not getting into business. Instead no, this lodu govt is instead regulating the Air fairs. **Marx & Lenin must be rolling in their graves when people call this govt right-wing**. That's the reason I respect left wing more than right wing. At least, left wing has philosophical clarity.

* Tell me who the fuck thinks India is growing ~~fastest~~ 7.5% per annum. If you look at the data, major indicators either shows stagnation or downward spiral. Private investment has actually gone down. Public investment has gone up. Just by changing calculation method, your GDP doesnt start growing overnight.

* Mr Modi has been extremely lucky that he took over when commodity & oil prices have been historically lower. In such a condition, it's quite easier to push difficult reforms but he wasted 19 months like that. **Even infamous UPA2 had balls to let the govt fall for the sake of India-US nuclear deal, this govt seems to have no balls**

* Mr Shourie had advised govt to pass the buck of land-reforms to state govt and instead focus on GST, labor & corporate laws. But Modi picked dumbfuck like Jaitley who acts like a lawyer. Govt could have easily passed GST & labor laws in 1st year itself but dint show any urge and now they have lost the momentum. Opposition has become stronger, now they would have to suck dicks to pass shit.

* Look at the education sector. How the fuck can we grow @10% with an unskilled & uneducated masses. This Irani is out to fuck everyone of us. No vision so far. **Instead filled all important education vacancies with RSS thugs. My problem is not installing RSS sympathisers but rather choosing losers who have no merit. COuld not she have chosen Anupam Kher instead of Gajendra Chauhan**. At least congress  chose Congress sympathisers for such posts who were a bit qualified.

* ** See the irony, Mr Modi talks about iPhones & Android when in reality every 4th girl of his country if bloody illiterate**. Madarchod, Facebook/twitter apni gaand me daal lo when every 4th woman of your country is illiterate.

* **This govt was supposed to be about minimum govt maximum governance but they imposed cess for Swachh Bharat**. Any sane person would have rather rationalized the existing tax regime and make it more transparent. But no, lets put some more tax and fuck formal sector employees in the ass.

There have been some reforms in power, infra & railway sector but that's that. These ministers are competent but they can't achieve much without over-arching reforms.


**I'm sorry for the rant but it hurts to see the daily chutiyaps of political brass when your country is going to shit every passing day. IF India wants to develop and feed its people, there is no right time like this. This opportunity can't be missed. Oil & commodities prices are lower, govt is in majority in Loksabha. It should persuade other parties and pass important reforms. There are more hungry people in india than whole Africa, we badly need progress**.

I'm done you can downvote now.

EDIT:- People sharing me links of govt plan to do awesome things. This is exactly what I'm saying, govt should do reforms and not talk about it only.

Oh! whither my India,6.0,3nzwl4,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3nzwl4/oh_whither_my_india/,18.0,"My India…..

A country that till 18 months ago, was blessed with perfect communal harmony, the country that enjoyed an absolute freedom of expression, the country that had not banned a single book, movie or play. 

No one had heard of the word ‘caste’ in my India and the word ‘religion’ either. There was no hunger, nor there was poverty. All the farmers were billionaires so no one ever committed suicide. It was a wonderful country where people could eat as much beef they wanted, anywhere they wanted. There were no laws banning cow slaughter in any state. No one had heard of words like corruption, murders and rape. 

Communal violence and riots were unheard of. The years 1947 and 1984 skipped India, therefore there were no such things as partition riots and anti-Sikh riots. The year 2002 however did happen in a terrible place called Gujarat, the single stain on the spotless secular fabric of India! Kashmiri Pandits lived in the valley in peace and harmony with their neighbours. The ethnic cleansing of the valley never happened. Serial bomb blasts and terrorist attacks were also terms that did not exist. 

Indians did not know what unhappiness or poverty or suffering meant. If they wanted to experience it, they would go on a conducted tour to Sudan or Palestine!

Such was the paradise that was my India!

Unfortunately, the good run did not last. 

16th May 2014, I still remember that dark day - the day Fascist Patriarchal Hindu Male Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister! 

That was the day India saw poverty, communal violence, law and order issues, farmer suicides, caste discrimination, gender discrimination, murders, rape, tax avoidance, spitting on the roads, litter in the streets, road rage and every other social evil that you can think of, for the very first time!! 

Thanks to this evil guy Modi, communal violence has crossed all limits. Every day millions of people are being massacred in India. At this rate, there will be no voters left to cast their vote in 2019! 

Some eminent historians and liberal thinkers have compared this regime to the Taliban - that social organisation formed by terrorists with no religion. The Taliban however is so hurt with this comparison that it wants Arvind Kejriwal to hold a dharna on its behalf!

We enlightened citizens know that oPM Modi is PERSONALLY responsible for everything from our constipation to clogged toilets at a railway station. I am upset that Modi has NOT issued a statement yet on why there are paan stains on the staircase leading to my building. Everything that is wrong in this country is the PM’s fault.

The problem with the India's daughter documentary,23.0,2y120e,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2y120e/the_problem_with_the_indias_daughter_documentary/,126.0,"I would like to start by the obvious a  reminder for you that rape is not a problem of India, nor is it a feature exclusively of India, our men , or their mindset. We should all know by now even if India accounted for the massive under reporting of rape we would still not even make the top 20 countries for rape per capita. Rape is an epidemic worldwide, it happens in all corners and all forms. 

And yet in western media narrative India is singled out as to make it seem we hold the exclusive rights to rape.

The problem with the Delhi rape was the manner in which it occurred and gruesomeness of it, which of course became free fodder for a western media already foaming at the mouth. But surely we don't believe that this was any worse the case of say Elizabeth Fritzl where the woman was held for over 20 years and raped while being held in a dungeon or  the case John Jamelske a serial rapist and murder . Yet we never saw a documentary or an outcry of rapes in America. Am I  excusing what happened certainly not. But surely it doesn't take a genius to recognise that the topic of rape and has somehow become the raison d'etre of the western media's narrative on India.

A place where men apparently can't control themselves. 

Of course knowing the history of western mainstream media we would know why this happens . 

It simply goes to a little book called Manufacturing consent by Noam Chomsky.

Do we ever hear about epidemic of rape in Australia or Sweden where there is the highest rape per capita in the world? Or did anyone make a documentary about these countries no. We are constantly led to believe western countries especially US and England are somehow places of upotpia whose citizens and governments can do no wrong ; despite Americans being responsible for the biggest genocide in the 21st century we in no way conflate Americans with murder. And yet somehow we a narrative continues that India and Indian men are rapists. 

But this is what they do they tell us Russia is bad and out to take over Ukraine despite the West being responsible for over throwing a sovereign Ukrainian government . They tell us the Chinese are aggressive and convince us we must join to stop this future world menace by surrounding them. Or the latest documentary which paints China as ignorant of the pleas of its people polluting them to their deaths despite every western nation having gone through the same process.

We saw a article in the economist which had no real substance but continously ranted about how India is somehow responsible for all the ills in cricket.

Am I saying India doesn't have problems . No. But this is what they do .

Surely at some point Indians will recognise that this is what the western media do . They manufacture consent. They continously drum through narrative . Narrative which is repeated enough times may actually cause their target audience to believe it to be true. In the 80's it was the USSR is bad and open up your economies and take IMF loans. 

Today its India is a land of rapists.

At some point we are going to have to stop taking the bait, or believe in the belittling that is constantly drummed out by a hemisphere which loses its influence everyday . We are going to have learn how to take a step back and say thanks but no thanks .

**Therefore I look through Reddit India or facebook I see more and more people saying these people do shame upon us that its hard to be an Indian in this moment, I ask you why? What justice do we do ourselves by accepting that the words of two individuals represent the republic and its citizenry? Are we so drummed out at that we have too somehow come to accept this narrative? If that be so shame it would be**",Non-Political,False,0.57,"[""The documentary does not stress on how India is the rape capital of the world and certainly does not compare it to other countries own rape statistics. It focuses on a particular sexual assault that stirred up the entire country and the mindset of the men responsible and the men who defended them. \n\nWhat conclusions people have about India after watching it is completely up to them. Would you make this statement if an Indian or even a NRI made the exact same documentary?\n\nThe documentary doesn't shame the country - the people in it do. And please stop your paranoia on 'Western media', you sound like those fundamentalists - the film was made by people, not secret government agents. \n "", ""There is something wrong with the picture you are trying to paint here. You say that Australia and Sweden has the highest per capita instances of rape in the world. I am not going into how Sweden's definition of rape and the method by which Swedes record rapes leads to inflation of their rape statistics. But do compare how life moves on for a rape victim in India with that in Sweden. You would agree its not the same. Rape is devastating for any woman, but that doesn't mean her life should stop after that. In the West, a rape victim has a lot many opportunities to get back to stability. In India, though, rape is just the beginning of a very difficult and traumatic life for majority of women. In other words, rapes do more damage in developing countries like India than in Western countries.\n\nSecondly, rape in India is just a symptom of a worse disease that exists in our society - treating women as inferior creatures. When you see people feeling ashamed and protesting on streets against rape, it is actually a culmination of all the anger they feel looking at the way women are treated in our country. I feel the same amount of anger and shame when I hear about a women killed for dowry, a girl child sold off into prostitution, a girl subjected to acid attacks. Our thoughts are rotten as far as gender dynamics are concerned and we need to accept that. Does this happen in Sweden and Australia too? May be. But it definitely won't be as severe as in India or any other developing country like us (Pakistan, Bangladesh, some of the African countries and ME countries).\n\nBBC and the western media may or may not have had an ulterior motive here. That is not the point and it doesn't deserve a priority now. The priority should be on how can we handle this mess and change our society's mindset. People talking about the documentary and the intentions of BBC are just creating noise and indirectly drowning the real issue."", '[deleted]']",False,True,False,False,False,True

The only way to get rid of debt is to declare bankruptcy

* Government(BJP) goes to poll this year and need extravagant amount of cash to spend . but and monetary favors are not free of cost , Ajay singh may be the desirable candidate to donate such sum in return of business growth and removing an important competition from market.

It is necessary to understand how every one gets benefited by Jet Airways Collapse, naresh goyal doesn't have to pay loan , spice jet get boosted more market share and less competition and government its evident ,but not one thought of 15000 family of Jet employee .

People here have been complaining constantly that the U.P. state government is accountable for ALL communal incidents in Uttar Pradesh, including Dadri. Now it turns out that that the violence has reduced..... Thank you Mudi?? Wtf??

**Fact #2: There is another study pointed out in the article which asserted that communal violence increased by nearly 25% in the first five months of 2015 under the Modi government.**

> The actual raw numbers are 287 incidents in January-May 2015 as against 232 incidents in the corresponding period 2014.

But the author has preemptively dismissed that study because **""there’s a relatively small absolute difference between the two numbers"" and ""there’s no way to know if the difference is statistically significant, the larger point is that by comparing any two arbitrary time periods, one can get just about any result you want.""**

First of all 25% is NOT ""relatively small absolute difference"". No way.

Second of all, what is this: ""comparing any two arbitrary time periods, one can get just about any result you want""???

But this is what the west does and has done for years. It masqueraded its agenda to manufacture consent quite often under the guise of human rights. For India the news cycle is Indian men are rapists and their women need to be saved. For China its communism dictatorship . For Russia its Putin .

One day you'll get your head out of the sand and come into the real world. Until then you can enjoy more of the same. And be associated with rape. Because thats exactly what they want.

More than that its what you deserve for being subservient

The inbred kid fuckers called me for the interview. There were 2 fuckfaces interviewing me: one a Bihari Math Professor who probably knows about 50 words in English, and a mallu man, whose wife probably fucks guys half her age in shitty blue films: hence, the reason why he had a perpetually frowning face.
I smiled and politely wished them, ""Good morning, sir"", twice, since there were two of them. But they didn't even look up! They just said, ""take a seat quickly."" I smiled and controlled my anger. They then asked me the usuals: where does your dad work, what does your mom do et cetera. They then looked at my 10th and 11th report card (i had scored 90 per cent in tenth ICSE, but my percentage dipped to 76 per cent,due to my bitch of a math teacher in my school, who couldn't teach math AT ALL, while I had an average of around 84 per cent, amongst the other subjects. I'm in ISC, by the way) and asked me, ""bhy did urr perchentage diph?"", To which I gave a shitty reply: something something I didn't put enough hard work, I have improved in twelfth grade something something (I really did improve in twelfth grade, I had an average of 83 per cent in my second preboards). There was an awkward silence for about 10 seconds. The mallu then asked me, "" white waere you at sent for yoour first semester exams?"". I was admitted to the hospital during this period for about 5 days, and was bedridden for nearly a month. I told them this. They thought I was lying. 

Fuckers. 

Anyway, the mallu mone asked me what my favourite subject was in economics. I replied: Keynesian economics. I said that Keynesian economics is ideally what economics must choose to achieve: to maximise human welfare. The cunt must've felt overwhelmed by my response. He then begins asking me technical questions. The fucker thought that I didn't know the answer to textbook questions and definitions. Boy was he wrong. 
Once the mallu ran out of questions, the Bihari Math cunt pounced in with the stupidest question: ""bhat is the dephinisun opf determinants?"" 

What. The. Fuck.

Who the FUCK KNOWS. It's a bunch of numbers with 2 lines on the sides. I said I didn't know the definition. The Bihari fuck wasn't that bad though, to be honest: his questions were all right.

One of my dad's friends, whose daughter studies in Christ, told me that their strict dress code was understandable: it instils discipline, he said. REALLY? NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES? IS THAT REALLY DISCIPLINE?

After ALL THIS, I found out later that night, that I did not get into that shit hole. I also found it that a guy who scored 53 per cent got in. I lost my shit after hearing that.

Look at what happened to ""Secularism"". Political groups used this legitimate issue and spun it into a guilt trip against their rivals. It may lead to a few electoral gains in the short run but over the long run, it leads to a massive under-current of resentment and a vicious backlash. Today, ""secularism"" is a joke in the Indian political discourse. ""True"" seculars are now begging people to forget all the propaganda in the name of secularism and revert back to its original nature.

Now these same elements (who ruined secularism) are trying to spin another legitimate issue (women's issues) into a guilt trip.

Just take a look at this article: [Women in India Aren’t Safe on Twitter Either: The sexual humiliation of the streets has moved online](https://medium.com/matter/no-safe-places-d59af0c3ba58).

This article is a joke. 

> These days, though, nowhere is protected: some Indian men are determined to use the web to target women whose opinions they hate or fear. And, just like street hoodlums, they employ a mob mentality, work in packs, and deploy sexual language to terrorize and humiliate women.

.

> It’s clear from their online behavior that these men are largely privileged Hindus, many of whom live outside India and enjoy well-paying jobs. Prominent political journalist Sagarika Ghose, who has 361,000 followers on Twitter, calls them “communal techies.” She also coined the now-ubiquitous term “Internet Hindu” in a reference to their infatuation with the Hindu right wing nationalist ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won an overwhelming majority in the general elections that were held in April. The Hindu far right is famously patriarchal, and blind to the humanity and individuality of women.

.

> Take poet and novelist Meena Kandasamy. She writes about sexuality with a rare frankness, has over 25,000 followers on Twitter, and is a regular target of abuse. Speaking to me from Chennai, she said that the particular vulgarity of the tweets she is subjected to is influenced by the fact that she belongs to a low caste.

.

> “They want to frighten me off Twitter,” she told me. “They want me in a subjugated role.” **Top lel**

.

> The fact that a low caste woman could be seen as successful, not just by the standards of her community, but by the intellectual mainstream, is galling to caste-obsessed right-wing Hindu men. **ROTFLing @ her wishful fantasies**

.

> Sagarika Ghose, despite the fact that she has a TV show and a newspaper column where she can publicly call out abusers if she chooses to. “I regularly receive rape threats,” she told me. “I’m regularly called a whore and a slut who sleeps with “Congi” (Congress) politicians and every day my timeline is filled with abuses like ‘ass licker,’ ‘slave,’ and ‘Congress sepoy’ [foot soldier].” **What did she expect? People will thank her for calling them Nazis and murderers? Lulz**

> Ghose shrugs off the abuse. “They’re playing out some perverse patriarchal fantasies of dominating strong women.”

> Though right-wing Hindu men seem to be the majority of abusers on Twitter, just as they are the majority of people on the ground in India, their tweets suggest a profound sense of victimization. They portray themselves as a sort of endangered species whose survival depends on extinguishing, if only verbally, the people who are different from them. **Can't you see the hilariously transparent agenda of the article? Lulz**

> Not all women have suffered the onslaught. Right-wing women are protected from the abuse, earning relative freedom by prodding liberal women—even those who don’t follow them or even know who they are—in growling packs, attacking them like some children strike animals with sticks and stones. **There you go. Its not about women. Its about these phony left-wing propaganda machines getting as good as they give.**

This is nothing but a bunch of left-wing moonbats engaging in a cringeworthy display of attacking the Indian voters who just handed them a historic electoral spanking. 

This is pure desperation. This is comic relief.

For better or for worse, we no longer live in an era of uni-directional media. The likes of Roy, Ghose, etc can no longer get away by calling people ""Nazis"", ""genocidal maniacs"", and ""murderers"" without getting a few choice abuses returned by the targets of their vicious propaganda.

And when people return their compliments, they go whining about MUH PATRIARCHY, MUH HINDOOO-RIGHT-WING. LOL. Do you see how pathetically hilarious this is?

Also, consider [this reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28msnd/the_sexual_humiliation_of_the_streets_has_moved/) by a well known left winger.

The thread attempts to use this joke of an article to go on a guilt trip about women's issues.  

Don't attempt to spin an electoral defeat into guilt trips, you'll end up making women's issues into a joke. Just like ""secularism"" has become a joke.

I have observed that the thought analyses of so called educated Indians is far less than Americans. I am beginning to wonder if we have lesser IQ(currently). My theory is stemmed from the following :

1. We never came out of our communal sentiments (caste based) even though we are aware it is all nonsense . We never even try to address it within ourselves nor we read extensively about its origins in school. Most general population never wonder why do we have ""classes"" within the same race? It is peculiar that communal sentiment is stronger than National sentiment. People actively participate in these sentiments.
2. We submit too much to ""gurus"" without making thorough investigation of them. We support their pseudo science because it protects our insecurities . We are fine with them occupying lands, controlling wealth , preaching enormous ignorance . They give lame explanations of effect of Saturn on some temples and why women should don't enter them. We never question the science behind it.
3. Our theatre arts (cinema ) is at its worst. We are such snowflakes that directors lives are threatened if they take movies that ""hurt"" communal sentiments. We don't want to hear truths . Or alt least look at it and judge it ourselves without making a huge political stunts. And unfortunately people support it. They have to always distort the truth to please the audience. What kind of cowardice is that? What's the purpose of the art?
4. There are no Science-fiction movies that can be thoughtful...like Inception, Martian or Interstallar . Most Indians don't even discuss these movies, let alone produce them. I wonder how much of our population even understand them or want to watch them?
5. We read more of current day to day politics than any other books out there. Never try to understand to go and think beyond. There is more interest in vanity (flaunting their cars, assets ) than acquiring knowledge.
6. Very egoistic and arrogant  but surprisingly devotees of either politicians , gurus or heroes. Their bhakti is unmatched to any other world .
7. They hesitate to question anything ancient and sacred. Lack of analytical skills?....
8. Our politicians represent our moral sense and values.
9. They believe that being educated is reading bunch class text books and ace the exams. Parents are extremely proud of their kids achievements and very ashamed of those who are academically backward( I mean those who can't boring drill for hours??)

[EDIT] If your answer is just Modi. Don't you think you need serious introspection 

[EDIT] Reason to support BJP ? 

Findings from people's comment

* Most of the people supporting BJP because of Modi and Modi alone. They don't even care if anythings else exist in BJP or not. 

* People choosing BJP because they think BJP is less shittiest of all the parties.

* Transparency does not matter to them. They think Modi is icon of development and no matter how BJP gets money or conduct it's businesses, Modi will do the development because he can do the development. 
 

* Lot of Indians give everyone at least one chance to pull us out of our misery. Right now, Modi's got the best shot at doing something.

*  Some very optimistic and faithfull supporters even said this 
>I am supporting BJP because I am able to trust them even though they are not disclosing their party funding.
Even in an implausible worst case scenario, if their funding comes from immoral businessmen, corrupt foreigners or religious fanatics, I am able to trust how uninfluenced they are regarding the source of money.

Honestly I can see only negative connotation in all the reasons given to chose BJP, that may be because I am disillusioned by parties actions but again I had said it earlier I am unable to trust it and I am still not convinced that why I should vote for BJP. But thank you guys for giving your side of story it may change the judgement of some other disillusioned voter even though it didn.t mine.

I like none but I have to choose one.\n\nTo start with Congress , I can compare it to a security guard who I appointed to guard my house. He stole from my house , but still I let him have his job. And , He did it again for the second time. I am no way going to let him have his job now.\n\nComing to AAP , it\'s like a bunch of security guards who are young , energetic and claim to protect my house and be loyal to me , delivering all the promises they made. I\'m impressed. I tell this neighbor of mine about these people who I think is amazing. Without a second though , my neighbor appoints them. My neighbor needs more guards for his house and AAP doesn\'t have that many guards. Now , Here starts a spring of nonsense. AAP security guards team up with Congress security guards who are known to be thieves. *I lost my hopes here*. And , Then after some days of guarding , they decide to quit because only one of their wants were not meant. That made no sense , hence I quit supporting them.\n\nBJP :\n\nBJP is like a gang of security guards. The guards have mixed-reviews. One of the guards has amazing experience , but does not lead the gang. He is just one among them. He has no power/very less power over the other guards to stop the immoral activities they do. But , when the association of these security guards comes to me and promises to make the experienced security guard their leader , I\'d choose them over the others.\n\n*Additional Notes*\n\n1. I was a die-hard AAP fan [](/s *AAPTard*) before they quit from Delhi. I lost some trust from them when they grouped with Congress , but *Chalta Tha*.\n\n2. Narendra Modi has previous experience and through the experiences of many friends about his administration in Gujarat , I am impressed.\n\n3. Arvind Kejriwal is just going on accusing everybody and follows a principle which read ""If You can not come up , pull the person above you down"". Many of his allegations are baseless , one-sided and just assumed. (Referring to the Gujarat Questions)\n\n4.

How are you guys trusting them?\n\nDisclosing party funding is not the be all and end all. There can be hundreds of legitimate reasons for not making donations public. For example, if I am donating money to some political party which is in opposition, I may want to keep it secret fearing persecution from the ruling party. Until there are electoral reforms and every party is made to disclose its funding, why should BJP have to handicap itself by doing so? Remember that BJP's competition is with Congress, not political nobodies like AAP.\n\nBesides, in the larger picture of the kind of problems the country faces, this is such a trivial non-issue. India is an extremely poor, third-world country where most people don't have access to the most basic of necessities. The previous government has done everything possible to squash the great Indian dream of becoming a developed nation by 2020. Right now, I feel that India desperately needs a stable government at the center that can provide clean, good governance and help India grow.

[NP] For Guy Virgins: Basic Things No One Told Me About Sex,34.0,3l9gb3,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l9gb3/np_for_guy_virgins_basic_things_no_one_told_me/,41.0,"I lost my virginity later than the average guy. Before I got laid for the first time I had read a fair amount about sex. I took Sex Education classes in school. I read articles on positions and techniques in Maxim and Cosmo. I read sites like www.sexuality.org. I read the Savage Love column every week. I also looked at tons of porn on the internet and through my PlayStation 2's handy DVD player. All in all, I thought even though I had never done it myself, I knew most of what there was to know about sex.

&nbsp;

Then I started having it and I kept discovering all these basic things that had somehow passed me by. In all the stuff I read and watched these things never came up. I never heard anyone talking about them either. I guess they assumed that the audience was already having sex and that knowing these things was a given. And it seems that porn glosses some things over or does not reflect what actual sex is like. I know, I'm as shocked as you are. So here's my list of basic sexual stuff that I only found out about when I came across it myself.

&nbsp;

Hopefully reading this will make life easier for the virgins out there in some way, you know, by lessening that fear of the unknown or whatever. I think the most common theme below is that sex is not as glamorous as it's sometimes made out to be. However, 'not glamorous' isn't the same as 'not enjoyable'. Sex is awesome. If anything, all the little quirks I'll mention below make it more fun.

&nbsp;

**Positions**

&nbsp;

From reading and watching porn I thought positions like missionary, doggy style, woman-on-top, etc. were simple, cut-and-dry things. I soon found out that each one has tons of subtle variations based on things like how you position your legs, the position of her legs, how deep inside her you are in a resting position, the angle you're thrusting in, the position of your upper body, how high or low your hips are on her body, how your bodies fit together, and so on and so on.

&nbsp;

With some variations her vagina will seem like a straight tunnel that you can easily go in-and-out, in-and-out of. With other variations you're mostly inside her, can only thrust a little, and you're more grinding pelvises together.  

For example, if you're in the missionary position:

* If you put your legs together and straight back, you'll get a different feeling then if you had them spread out to your sides and had your knees further up on the bed.
* If she spreads her legs you'll be able to thrust in one way. If she lifts them up and wraps them behind your back, you'll be able to thrust deeper.
* If you rest on your elbows you'll enter her at one angle and be able to thrust in a certain way. If you straighten your arms and rest on your hands you'll thrust at a different angle.
* If the top of your hip bone roughly matches up with hers you'll get a certain angle and depth. If you try to 'ride higher' you'll get a different angle and depth.
* If your upper body is parallel to hers things'll go one way. If you raise your torso up to around 45 degrees things'll be slightly different.
* What works one way with a petite girl may not feel the same with a girl who's closer to your height.
* The idea is you have to play around with these variations in position to find a way that feels good for both of you (or just you if you're selfish).

&nbsp;

**Vaginal lubrication**

You probably know that the vagina secretes a natural lubricant and that women get 'wet'. I knew that basic fact too, but I learned some more things about the process firsthand.

&nbsp;

* It runs out at some point and she'll get dry, and eventually uncomfortable, during sex. Sometimes you have to pull out and apply some lube. At other times you can keep going for a bit and she'll get wet again.
* If the girl gets too wet during sex it can reduce the friction to the point where you don't really feel anything. If she's too dry it doesn't feel that great for you either.
* If enough of it accumulates it has a whitish, mayonnaise look to it. Sometimes you'll finish having sex and when you pull out and look down you'll see a big drop of it running down between her legs.
* If you're going at in the missionary position, it may run out on to the bed and leave a wet spot on the sheets that's a bit white when it dries.

&nbsp;

**Erections**

If you watch porn you may wonder why the guy's erection is sometimes slow to grow. You're thinking that if you were in his shoes you'd be as hard as a rock in a second.

&nbsp;

* Nope, the same thing will happen to you. Once the intial thrill of hooking up with this girl/girls in general wears off, your erection will often start to get soft when your penis isn't being directly stimulated.
* Being drunk, being distracted, and bad technique on the girl's part can contribute to your not getting it up quickly.
* After putting on a condom you may need to jerk yourself off for a second to get it a bit harder before you stick it in her.
* If it's not hard enough you'll have a hard time putting it in. It'll tend to bend or slide out of the way instead of penetrating. However, if it's slightly soft and you manage to get in it, you can often get it harder quickly once you start thrusting.
* If the sex isn't great and/or you're distracted and/or something messed up happens you may start to go soft once you're inside her.

&nbsp;

**Sticking it in**

You've probably heard jokes about this before. Yep, it can be hard to find the hole. Even if you know where you need to go visually, the vaginal entrance can be smaller and tighter than you think so you may not feel exactly where you need to insert the tip of your penis.

&nbsp;

* With missionary it's fairly obvious where you need to put it, but if you're trying to guide it in blind then it can be awkward.
* With doggy style the hole is further up then you'd think.
* When the girl is on top the angle of her vaginal tunnel can give you problems and you can't really see what you're doing. It's best if she guides it in herself.
* Like I said above, if you're a bit soft then you can have trouble putting it in.
* If you fail to get it in properly your dick will slide somewhere else and may feel like it's in for a second or two.
* All this is more difficult if you have a condom on, as it's harder to feel what you're doing.

&nbsp;

**Climaxing**

You may also watch porn and wonder why the guy sometimes has to jerk off for a few minutes before delivering the money shot. You're thinking if you were in that position you'd pop off no problem.

&nbsp;

* Again, the same thing may happen to you. Sometimes you'll be having sex/getting a blowjob/jerking off and you won't be able to cum. If the stimulation isn't effective it can happen. If you put too much pressure on yourself to orgasm on demand it can happen.
* The more common stereotype is that men finish too quickly and that they have to think about stuff like baseball in order to last any real length of time. But not being able to cum happens too. Not all guys are losers who are done in thirty seconds. Finishing too soon definitely happens, but not every single time.
* In many cases you're not just going to cum instantly as soon as you start pounding away, you have to find the speed, angle, depth, etc. that feels good for you. It's not automatic, just like you can't just masturbate in any random way. You have to do what's effective for you.
* On a related note, women don't always want to have marathon sex sessions. Sometimes they'll get tired of the guy stabbing away endlessly, especially if it's not doing anything for them. Sometimes they'll start to get dry and sore. Sometimes they'll have an orgasm or two and think that's enough. Sometimes they'll just be happy with a good twenty minutes of fun sex and not have any need to go for longer.

&nbsp;

**Minor injuries**

* It can be irritating to your skin when your sweaty pubic hair rubs against hers.
* Someone's hair my get accidentally pulled or caught.
* Someone may clumsily fall over as you're changing positions (e.g., when she's getting off you from being on top, when you try to transition from missionary with you kneeling and her laying down to missionary with both of you laying down).
* You may hit your head against the headboard, har har har.
* When you're going at it missionary style you can end up hitting the bottom of your bladder on her pelvic bone. That gets old after ten minutes...
* Your knees and elbows can get sore after a while from rubbing on the bed/floor/etc.
* During doggy style if you slip out and then accidently thrust back into her pelvis. This can hurt the tip of your dick.
* If she's riding you and you slip out she can come down on your dick. Usually it gets bent a little and hurts for a minute. At the worst you can rupture the tissue and take a trip to the hospital.
* You may get scratches, bruises, pulled hair (purposely this time), and bite marks. That's cool.
* You may fall off the bed or hit your elbow against the wall or something else like that. You just gotta laugh when this shit happen.

&nbsp;

**Condoms**

First let me say that you should always wear these things despite what I say below. You know what can happen if you don't. You may have heard guys complain about condoms, saying they kill the mood or whatever. It's true, they are kind of annoying.

&nbsp;

* They kill spontaneity. You can't smoothly progress from foreplay to sex. You have to stop the action to go grab a condom, open it, and then put it on.
* They smell bad.
* They kill sensation, sometimes to the point where you can barely feel your own dick inside the girl. On the plus side, they can allow you to last longer.
* Sometimes when you're inside the girl they'll bunch up in weird ways and feel strange.
* They interrupt the flow of things after sex is over. You have to pull out, take the condom off, and get rid of it.

&nbsp;

**Messiness**

You probably know this already, but overall sex is messier than what you see on t.v. or in porn.

* You're going to get hot and sweaty of course.
* The woman's lubrication is going to dribble all over the place and possibly stain the sheets. Someone is going to get semen on them at some point. Condom wrappers are going to litter the ground. You may kiss passionately and slobber all over each other.
* Someone may let out a fart right in the middle of things.
* Sometimes when you pull out and she changes positions she'll fart out her vagina (queefing).
* If you finger her your fingers may be covered with a lot of her clear lubricant when you pull them out. You may have to wipe them off on your leg or something. Classy.
* If you have sex when she's on her period, well use your imagination.
* If you have anal sex you may get some poo on your dick.
* If you have a good session, when you're done you're going to be sweaty, red faced, tired, and a bit out of it. Your hair will be messed up, gross stray hairs will be stuck to your skin, the girl will have a bit of white lubricant running out of her cootch. You'll have a bit of cum dribbling out of your dick. There will be at least one condom wrapper on the floor, the sheets and pillows will be all over the place, and the bed will have a wet spot on it. If you cuddle afterwards you'll start to stick together and it'll feel gross when you pull apart. It's great.

&nbsp;

**General differences from masturbation and porn**

If I had to give a simplified summary I'd say masturbating is all about the visuals while actual sex is more about physical feelings. Of course masturbation is about the physical feelings too, but if you're anything like me, the visuals drive the experience and provide most of the excitement. When you're using your imagination you keep flipping between different scenarios until you hit on one that does it for you. When you watch porn you probably skip around between different DVD scenes or online clips until you hit on one that turns you on the most.

&nbsp;

With sex some positions give you something to look at, but you're hardly sitting in a chair watching a scene that has been shot from a distance and angle that gives you a good view. If you're doing a girl in the missionary position you're too close to her to see anything. Your eyes are probably closed, or if they're open they may not be focused on anything. You're probably kissing her or you may have your head nuzzled in her neck. Cut off from the visuals you instead concentrate on the tactile sensations; your dick going in and out of her vagina, your bodies pressed together, her hands scratching your back, her breath on your cheek, how hot you are, the sweat forming on the small of your back, your hands grabbing her boobs, kissing, and various little aches, tired spots, and discomforts. And then there are the sounds and smells; body parts slapping together, her breathing and moaning. The smell of latex, sweat, someone's breath, or her vag.

&nbsp;

Of course, sometimes when you're going at it you'll be picturing things in your head to help yourself get off. Like maybe your girlfriend is going down on you and that feels pretty nice, but not quite perfect, so you imagine a porn scene or hot girl you saw the other day to get yourself over the edge.

&nbsp;

Also, when you watch porn you can mistakingly associate the visual act you're witnessing with the sensations you're giving yourself. For example, say you have a thing for titty fucking scenes in porn. And let's say as you're watching, you're masturbating in a fast, intense manner. You know your body so of course it's going to feel good. But actual titty fucking probably doesn't feel like your fast, intense, just-right wanking. The true physical sensations may or may not be your cup of tea. You may find them too slow or soft for your tastes and be disappointed in the real thing. Here's another example: Maybe when you watch porn you really like the reverse cowgirl position (girl on top facing away from the guy). As a third party observer this position gives you something to look at. But when you're actually the guy all you see is the girl's back and, again, the sensations of her riding you aren't the same as the just-right wanking feelings you gave yourself when you were watching two other people doing it.

&nbsp;

**Some more observations about how real sex differs from porn and the movies**

&nbsp;

* Obviously in real life it's a lot more sweaty, clumsy, grunty, and primal than dramatic Hollywood love scenes make it out to be.
* In porn the positions are all about making the sex visable to the camera and to give you a good look at the woman's body. In real life concerns such as being close to each other often take precedence.
* Personally I've never had sex under the sheets. They just get in the way.
* Personally I think having sex with all your clothes on kind of sucks (it's a bit awkward and skin on skin contact feels so much better), but you see it all the time in movies and t.v. shows (e.g., The Sopranos). Of course they've got other, more practical, reasons for portraying it like this.
* What amuses me in movies now is what you could call the 'instant penetration.' You see it all the time if you look for it. A man and woman will be in their underwear, or even fully clothed, in some sexually charged situation. Maybe the woman is sitting on the man's lap (both in their underwear remember), or the man is standing behind the woman. The camera is focused on their faces. Then the guy will make a little movement, the woman will gasp, and then they'll close their eyes and start moaning, the implication being that the man achieved vaginal penetration off-camera. Yeah, not that quick and easy in real life. You've got to move your clothes out of the way, line things up, the guy has to be hard enough, the woman needs to be pretty wet, and often the man has to guide his penis in with his hand. Otherwise it's a much more awkward procedure.

My 17 year old daughter is flirting with 5 guys right now; and I am worried.,0.0,4ajrf2,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ajrf2/my_17_year_old_daughter_is_flirting_with_5_guys/,40.0,"So, this is the story so far..

I am 54 year old father, living in Mumbai, and earning more than 7 figures a year. Stable job, nice cars and sea facing apartment. Wife is super sweet, all into community work and stuff. Only daughter, who just turned 17.

This post is regarding my daughter. I have just discovered that she is a super flirt (boy, even overtaking me and her mom). As I am typing this, she is right now flirting (some serious shit) with 5 guys, at the same time on Whatsapp, Skype, Line and some other messenger I suppose.

Now, how I found out?

We have installed a hidden CCTV camera in her room (since she was 5 years) and lately, I have found myself listening to the conversations sometimes. The passion and truth with which she enchants, entices these innocent boys is amazing. 

Now, let me tell you.. she has a CC with Rs 5 lakh limit, and we are going to buy her a Micra car next year, when she turns 18. Yes, the guys she is flirting with are rich brats, and money is not the issue here. It seems she loves to flirt, and then dispose them like tissue papers.

I am worried that she may land up in trouble, in case a psycho type of guy falls in 'real' love with her. She is good in studies, and we were planning to send her to Oxford or something, but now, I am real worried.

So, parents of r/India.. how will you handle this situation? Should I talk to her? Talk to the boys? (one of them recently gifted her a painting he painted, and it was superb. She just burnt it yesterday! I mean, is this a disease or something?)

Edit 1: I know the feeling when a girl rejects you, especially when you are 18 years. Its harder than the slap. Hence, I am worried that her flirting nature may land her in trouble. Sooner or later.

Edit 2: I am not a creepy old daddy, who is invading her privacy. I am a concerned dad, and want the best for my child.",Non-Political,False,0.47,"[""> earning more than 7 figures a year.

Too much bragging, irrelevant info fed into the post..\n\n\nAnyway, there might be someone out there who might be interested to know people's opinion on this situation. So my advice...  \n\n1. Remove the CCTV from her room. That is just too creepy. And know what? If it is indeed a CCTV camera, which records video and audio, and if she doesn't know about this, by the current laws, you are a criminal. You are in hold of recordings of a 17 year old girls' activities in the house which can be considered as being in possession of child pornography.\n\n2. Stop listening to the conversations she is having in the privacy of her room. She's almost an adult. She has the right to secrets.\n\n3. She's 17. With raging hormones. Imagine the things you have done while in your teens. She just have access to more resources (Smartphones, Computer, Internet). \n\n4. Talk to your daughter. Be a friend to her.. Ask her about her boyfriends.. Provide her an environment in which she can actively discuss these things in her home without you and your wife being judgmental and critical.. She will open up.. That's how you deal with this.. Not by prying into her personal life without her knowing.. \n\nEdit: corrected a typo"", 'Oh the masters have returned!

Tanzanian girl's incident in Bangalore is just Mob violence.

Home Minister Dr. G Parameshwarappa has given much importance to the fact that death of the innocent local is outweighed by the shame caused due to false reports on the foreign student.

**This is what happened on that day** -

Mohammad ahmed Ismal, a sudanese, was driving a fiat car under the influence of alchohol. He rammed his vehicle into K. Sanavulla and his wife Shabana Taj causing shabana Taj to die on the spot. The locals chased the car which was fleeing the scene. His car was stopped and when he tried to run, he was beaten by few people. When this was happening, a Wagon-R with three of his friends entered and fought the people, took ahmed with him and fled. Anguished by this, they torched ahmed's car. Not only this, they stopped the Wagon-R at Saptagiri Hospital on Hesaraghatta Road. At this time, the following were in the car - Lina Martina, Saloom and Jamal Ibrahim along with Ahmad who was involved in the earlier accident.

**It is true that her clothes were torn**

After they were stopped the 4 tried to fight the locals and this further angered them and beat all of them including the girl. It was seen that there were more than 50 involved with the mob. Lina's clothes were torn in the scuffle. Police who arrived on the scene took ahmed into custody. But, it has to be known that nowhere in all of this was lina sexually assaulted or paraded nakedly. A local resident, prameela, has further said, if at all there was a naked parade they would've done it to ahmed who ran people over, but there was no reason to parade Lina.

* sudden visit by the DGP for this accident but not for any of the local rapes such as the ones in madawala, cubbon park, or the school child's rape. Doesn't local sexual assaults not worthy of this much attention?
* No one is bothered about the dead victim who had nothing to do with this. She hasn't even received any condolences from any official involved. (think what would've happened if BJP was in power here)

**Answers needed by the home ministry for the following** -

* Does the ministry doesn't know about the other illegal  activities of African students?
* Isn't the local news report not according to your requirement?
* Haven't you noticed the attack by these students on the police

I would still vote for modi & BJP.  Despite of being disappointed with him and his team on multiple occasions, I believe BJP is still better of the devils. 

I'm impressed with his vision and the work he's have done so far on nation's infrastructure ( especially roads and railways ). 

I'm also impressed by his efforts towards changing our traditional Indian way of living (e.g. spreading awareness about cleanliness , promoting accountability and transparency in govt departments, Psu etc).

When I voted for him in 2014 I knew that issues he is targeting won't go away magically in few years. Practices like corruption, spreading filth and pollution, zero sense of personal and professional accountability are deep rooted in our society. No modi, gandhi or anyone else can fix these issues in a term.

On rape , I see it is an unfortunate endemic majorly due to our traditionally patriarchal yet repressed society. I understand  that with more females getting aware of their rights and with support of law such incidents will surely go down in numbers. This is why , though  I am deeply embarrassed and disappointed by how Kathua and UP incidents were handled by BJP, I refuse to see them as a report card of Modi government.


To sum it , I'd give another term to Modi. Despite of many flaws , he has the better vision  for our country going forward.

Yes, westerners do come to India, but not because its a beautiful place, as they claim.

The whites do not even consider us worth speaking to, then why do are we so eager and over-friendly towards them? I know I am gonna sound like a Kulcha warrior but there really are good things in the Indian culture which we **must** be proud of.

Of course, you can't put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they're not actually praying, would do anything like that. That is literally the mission of the Tablighi Jamat, they're basically Muslim sanyasis. Seriously, it's a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the ""material world"", as they call it. They're literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn't pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. 

Obviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about ""jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot"". Sure, maybe they have been uncooperative because they're stubborn fools, but I doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao. 

Of course, this is my opinion, based on my knowledge and experiences, and everyone is free to believe what they want, but I'd encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days. More so when you're sitting with your family, watching channels like Aaj Tak or Zee News (I know boomers love sensationalized news stories). Don't believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof. Most people here know this, but these channels are trying to push a narrative (with support from certain people), and they'll go to any lengths to do so. Facts and consequences don't matter to these people, as long as they get more viewers.

[R]Why Owaisi is now relevant to me.,2.0,dvbpn6,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dvbpn6/rwhy_owaisi_is_now_relevant_to_me/,30.0,"TLDR: Because there is no alternative.

A few days before the results of the 2015 Delhi elections came out, a Hindu lady I was speaking to about the ongoing Ghar Wapsi controversies, remarked that Owaisi made a lot of sense when he retorted that since Islam states that every one is born a Muslim, hindu's that convert to Islam would actually qualify for 'Ghar Wapasi'. 

I was in the middle of Atheist enlightenment phase of my life and I scoffed at her. Owaisi was just one more religious rabble rouser, I said. She reiterated: It makes sense within the religious context, because both sides aim to use a religion argument. I agreed to that while still chuckling at what I saw as a non-meritorious argument.


When the Babri Masjid verdict came out on Saturday, my first reaction was to google what Muslim leaders thought of the verdict. It had never bothered me before that there was none I found remotely interesting or even appealing, but it did now. I sadly googled the relevant keywords followed by Owaisi and refresh the page a few times hoping something would come up.

It was as if I was in the Chappelle skit, mockingly calling for Ja Rule to make sense of the disaster that was hurricane Katrina(?) - except that it was in total earnestness. Such is the state of my community that we have so few representatives - some of which have happily sold themselves to the saffron. 

I've since accepted that for even if only for the current period of time, he is the one Muslim politician that I look at as a leader. 


I imagine so many hindus must gravitate towards Modi with a similar distaste of the available hindu leaders, but if in a country with a billion people of your community, a community that has representation across financial and political spectrum and the best man you find to look upto as a leader is a fella previously accused of genocide - let off only because he destroyed the evidence, I'd say that your reasons for looking upto him are suspect. 


So here I am. A decidedly non practicing Muslim that now follows Owaisi's political career with quite some interest. I might even vote for him given the chance. Either way, i'm rooting for him.

But, as we know, Raj Thackeray’s threats to Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which had employed Pakistanis, had a very different intent. After the patriot swore to vandalise theatres that screened the film, director Karan Johar, who does not have dandruff, appeared in blacks in a short film. He promised that he would never cast Pakistanis again. Some refined Indians were enraged by his act, which many of them termed a “capitulation”. But it is daft to be disappointed by Johar.\n\nSuccessful people, like Johar, often cannot and do not stand up to thugs. They are wise. They have much to lose. It is much easier for losers or those with very limited success, especially those in solitary professions, like writing, to take bold positions, which they usually do to display their low-stakes courage.\n\nRead | Mob vs Karan Johar: It’s a pity when citizens are forced to profess patriotism\n\nNo matter what artistes and journalists say, it is beyond their means to take on street thugs and their handlers. It is the job of the primary thug, who is a legitimate power in an orderly society. In fact, the primary thug decides what is legitimate. The entire civilised world is based on the simple understanding — the alpha thug, also known as the government, in return for a generally agreed-upon protection money, also known as taxes, would grant regular people considerable freedoms and guard them from all other secondary thugs.\n\nVery often in the past, central and state governments in India have failed to perform just this. As a result they have ceded too much ground to even puny, petty freelancers. This has impoverished and diminished the prestige of the government and is a reason why Indians do not like to give it any protection money, a reluctance that further erodes order in the society.\n\nRead | Is India sliding down the slippery road to anarchy?\n\nIn the past several decades, the Congress governments conceded ground to smaller thugs to sustain a notion of secularism, which was intellectually, philosophically and etymologically flawed. The secularism of the Congress was not complete absence of god from State, but that every god had a right to disrupt governance and society — some gods more than others, of course. As a result politicians, godmen and clerics could often challenge governments.\n\nThe BJP government, by appearing to negotiate with Thackeray, greatly diminished itself. When the Indian middle-class wished for a strongman to lead the nation, what they meant was that they wanted the government to assert its legitimacy and create order. It is amusing that the issue of nationalism should make the BJP, which rules both the Centre and Maharashtra, choose the path of timid placation instead of giving Thackeray the AAP treatment, which is the act of shoving an adversary into prison. It is possible that the BJP is not as scared of Thackeray as it is of the AAP.\n\nRead | ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ row: BJP will ruin country, says Delhi CM Kejriwal\n\nThe Ae Dil Hai Mushkil drama is very similar to what happened in late 2014 to Sony’s The Interview, a film in which two American journalists are assigned to kill the North Korean soft-toy dictator, Kim Jong-un. Days before the release, there was a cyber-attack on Sony. The US government said that the attack was conducted by North Korea in response to the impending release of the film. Sony, shaken by the attack, decided to junk the film. The corporation claimed that big theatre chains and other forms of distributors wished to have nothing to do with the film.\n\nThe American artistic community was disgusted. Sony had “capitulated”. They wished Sony would show more courage. The writer Paulo Coelho offered to purchase the rights to the film for unclear intent. Barack Obama, too, was disappointed. “I wish they had spoken to me first,” he said. Sony, by shelving the film, had shown a lack of confidence in the ability of the US government to protect it. Eventually, the corporation did release the film.\n\nRead | The State must stop MNS from dragging Indian Army into politics\n\nIn both the instances, various sets of humans behaved in predictable ways. The business community was practical and willing to choose the humiliation of surrender. The central corruption of money is in its ability to denude humans of personality, convictions and moral spine. In both the cases, representatives of the government were wise enough to be embarrassed. They promised protection.\n\nAs silly as it is for the government to negotiate with small illegitimate thugs, is the propensity of the artistic community to negotiate with the government for its very legitimate freedoms. A freedom of expression that is granted by the government, smaller thugs and the society, is a freedom that is usually worthless. The real value of artistic freedom lies in the reluctance of an authority to grant it. The charm of a freedom is in its very ambiguity.\n\nRead | Fadnavis missed chance to show ‘56-inch chest’ govt in place: Sena on film row\n\nIndian artistes should now consider ways of working with Pakistani artistes because the threats from big and small cultural thugs, and the feeble stand of the government, have ensured that a mere association with Pakistanis has an intrinsic artistic value because the defiance of the underdog is, after all, a big part of art.\n\nManu Joseph is a journalist and the author of the novel, The Illicit Happiness of Other People\n\nTwitter: @manujosephsan\n\nThe views expressed are personal\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.5b ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper)""]",False,False,False,False,False,False

Sentiments of a *numerical *minority .Please stop talking.Emotional Post.,0.0,3nhc83,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3nhc83/sentiments_of_a_numerical_minority_please_stop/,26.0,"Long time lurker here and is prepared to debate, not a bhakt , never was, using a different account .
Background:

Cow was never worshiped in our home.

 Have been feeding cow and calf in my home, Every Morning and every After Noon for 19+ years and still doing whenever getting chance to do.

We always have had an extended joint family and we never purchased milk  from outside.
I cannot digest milk from Amul or Tirumala or Dairy Mother or whatever because I throw up.

We have and always had and will always have  land next to our hut(Yes, Not a pakka,real, house) in which the shelter we give to cow are as good as the ones we have(can afford) ourself.

Be it rainy season and it is 2 AM in the night, one of my family, and  many a times me, used to go and double check if the cow and calf are not getting drenched.(Sometimes the roofs would just start leaking :())

Before having tea in the morning one of our family  feeds the cow and calf and if moderate sunlight is expected put the cow and the calf outside shelter.

If we discovered too much sunlight then someone had to rush from the farm to make sure the calf and cow are not getting heated.

Maintaining a cow is  expensive , we made sure that we commit the double the amount of food for the calf and cow  which we might need during each month.

Also, whenever the cow got any sickness  it was as much,if not more pressure (economic,emotional) and stress on elderly members (extended family) to what it would have been had one of the younger child got any sickness.


Also, in some cases you can ignore the sickness of some adult so that it can take care of itself but not in case of cows and calf.


Somehow you have to be always prepared to get injections and animal  doctor help if the calf and cow make out of pattern sound any day.

The love of calf and cow is quite cute, just before milking the cow we would release the calf for a few minutes to be with the cow.


While milking the cow we would always make sure the cow is licking the calf with love.


Also, if the calf is new born we would not milk the cow for one month and let the calf have all the milk,both in morning and evening.

Many a days if and only if the weather would be moderate, we would leave the cow in the open field to roam and graze(on land over which anyone's cow can graze) and in the evening(read sunset) the cow (not always) would and do come back to their designated place, and we would feed them.

Water temperature is always double checked whenever we give the cow and the calf water to drink and to mix in the food we give them.

And, Yes, I have regularly used cow dung   paste(with my bare hands ) to make goitha and used it in winter to regulate the cold in home and the cow shelter land.

Also, we have to have quite a few blankets to cover the cow shelter in winter seasons.And, you cannot just put fire in the place and smoke the cow and calf (cannot afford the AC for neither ourself nor the cow).


My mother and other elderly members see the news these days, and I have to see and hear the sadness everyday.

**It is like hearing the story of death of one of your own would be babies.**

**Has the world become that barbaric ?   


 **What If I tweet, I just ate a baby whose daddy used to eat cow flesh ?**
It is impossible for me to even type the word over which the people are debating the ban.

**It is not possible for me to imagine,let alone type the word,forget imagining humans chewing it(Yes, I know it has some vitamin which is not found otherwise in other foods), of the B.ban.**

**Please, Stop talking about it.**


I know I cannot stop people from doing(read eating)  other things and I am fully aware of the math  that same surface area land if used for grazing by cows will give different  return on investment if  the cow is  not used for milking consumption but other uses.

Yes,I also Know that My country exports largest amount.

Please,Stop Talking about and stop using the B word.


Imagine  cats,birds,puppies being chewed in your neighborhood and you have been having  them as loving pets forever.
And,Do not give me the analogy of colored fish.


I refrain to disclose my caste, but my counting numbers My caste is a minority.

Before you attack myself Note :

~~I work for one of the top 10 richest software companies (NOT SERVICE BASED ), and I am from nobody's tier 5  college and I have long time  American Girlfriend (~~Pure White~~ (  I mean it).~~

My points are :

1. Make a law so that Cannibals  don't get discriminated against in office and residential area .

2. Buying and selling of human meat should be made legal . The licenses should be issued in a strict manner with all the background checks put in place so that no mischief is done .

3. Only Adult person's meat should be available . Any other meat should be considered illegal .

4. Age of consent should be decided , my recommendation is 16 years or more .

5. Prior permission from magistrate court should be taken before slaughtering a human . 

6. Consent of the person to be slaughtered and the person buying should be done in person before the magistrate .

7. The person buying can't move back on his claim over the dead body .

8. Money , place and time of slaughter should be mentioned before hand .

9. The money shall be given to the nominee of the person to be slaughtered . Nominee should be a relative of the person .

It provides them with zero balance accounts, a debit card, accidental and life insurance, and enables direct benefits transfer to their bank account.

[Per this article from Firstpost](http://www.firstpost.com/business/jan-dhan-scores-drop-zero-balance-accounts-lpg-subsidies-flow-2076995.html) (with data sourced from the scheme's website):

>According to the latest figures available from the PMJDY website, some **125.5 million bank accounts have been opened** as on 31 January. Of these, **84.5 million are zero balance accounts**.

>On 31 January, the **zero-balance accounts were down to 67 percent of the total, down four percent from the 71 percent which had no cash in them just 10 days before** that. 

>It is estimated that **nearly eight million fresh accounts have become operative with some cash balances in them during this 10-day period.**

>**Of the 15-and-odd crore LPG users, nearly 9.75 crore have signed up for direct benefits transfer**, which is a healthy 66 percent of the total.

>At last count, **Jan Dhan accounts had Rs 10,500 crore of balances, which too is growing robustly. Ten days ago, the balance was Rs 9,218 crore – a rise of 14 percent.**

>According to a review of the DBT scheme on 31 January by the Prime Minister, data from 54 districts where the scheme was rolled out initially show that **“growth of subsidised LPG has reduced significantly, accompanied by a corresponding increase in the sale of commercial LPG.** This indicates that the scheme will enable substantive savings in subsidy which can then be deployed for other productive purposes, without reducing any entitlements of existing consumers.”

Now let us look at [former IRS officer Kejriwal's take on the scheme](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/arvind-kejriwal-ridicules-modis-jan-dhan-yojna-says-no-money-in-peoples-account/):

>AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal today ridiculed ‘Jan Dhan Yojna’ **claiming lakhs of accounts opened under Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s pet scheme have ‘no money’ and people will get insurance benefits under it only after death**.

>“I heard the Prime Minister talking about opening bank accounts of lakhs of people (under Jan Dhan Yojna (JDY)) **but then where is the money?** He now said that they will give insurance of Rs one lakh, which a person will get after he dies,” he said while addressing a rally.

Of all the schemes, actions, and statements of the government, he chooses to ridicule the one scheme that could free the most marginalised sections of society from the clutches of moneylenders, ensure government welfare reaches them instead of being siphoned off, and provides them with accident and life insurance.

Just saw Piku on Netflix. How did this bullshit casteist drivel get so much praise?,1.0,40lcbj,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/40lcbj/just_saw_piku_on_netflix_how_did_this_bullshit/,35.0,"Expletives ahead. Tread cautiously. 

I'm going to just hide my angst for this and state instances. 

1. Every major character is a Brahmin or a non-Dalit. Nothing wrong in that, except the only Dalit mentioned, cleans Amitabh Bacchan's ass. Why the fuck is every character a Bannerjee or a Chatterjee? In an entire fucking movie, did Shoojit Sircar never think how pretty fucked up this whole premise sounds?

2. Why the fuck is the only Dalit cleaning toilets? Do they only exist to do that?

3. Why the hell does Irrfan Khan refuse to sit next to the cleaner? And how the fuck is he the ""good"" guy therefore? What the fuck was that? So fucking shocking. How on earth did the director think this was okay?

4. Why is everyone so hell bent on last names? Like honestly. Why? 

Argh. I could cite many more subtle instances but I'll stop now. It's a terrible nonsensical movie with so much blatant casteism, it's jarring. I'm surprised no one protested. But I guess showing Dalits their place is the hip thing to do. And this bullshit is one of the better movies of the year? 

In the US, Aziz Ansari created Master of None to point out these discrepancies, only then, race was the major talking point. The parallels in India are eerily shocking. To the people who say casteism is dead, no. It's alive and thriving and being praised in mainstream pop culture. Open your fucking eyes. And this is supposed to be progressive cinema? The fuck!

Shame on us really.

Focusing on the development claims of Gujarat versus the rest of India, here are its findings:

1. Gujarat ranks 11th in overall Human Development Index (HDI), behind Kerala, Delhi, Himachal, Goa, Punjab, North East, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and J&K.

2. It ranks 17th in terms of the change in HDI in 2000--2008; it is below the national average.

3. It ranks 15th in terms of the change in the Income Index (consumption expenditure); it is below the national average.

4. It ranks 21th in terms of the change in the Education Index; it is below the national average.

5. It ranks 12th in terms of the change in Health Index; it is below the national average.

Even in terms of other indicators like poverty, child nutrition, women's health, infant mortality, life expectancy, sex ratio, availability of toilets, drinking water, literacy rate, pucca house, mobile phones, road length, etc. it fares in the middle of the pack.

Compare that to now, the change is incredible - all roads are electrified, streets are clean with no animals breeding outside your front door, the city has a much better sewage system etc. Same goes for Surat and Ahmadabad.\n\nYou talk about education - keep in mind that Gujarati culture has little emphasis on this as compared to the rest of the country. I am the only one along with 1 cousin on both sides of my family who has anything besides an undergrad degree, most of my family (prior generation) didn't bother to do much beyond school, but they didn't need to - a lot of people joined their family business which is considered normal. \n\nAnother factor I have to point out is tourism - the government has set up safaris and tours for Gir and the Kuchch desert. These are entirely state run and are better than any private tour I've been on in India - great food, accomodation, entertainment, great value for money especially considering how little the state has to offer for tourism to begin with as compared to Rajasthan, Maharashtra etc. Same goes for tours in Ahmedabad where you have great city tours in english and hindi, very professionally run.

Problems with the Indian Diet -- Ray Peat,18.0,4k23eh,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4k23eh/problems_with_the_indian_diet_ray_peat/,68.0,"I'll start off by saying that I'm Indian, born and raised in the states, and have solved a load of problems through altering my diet/lifestyle.  In particular, I've reversed my hair loss, and cured my anxiety.  

I was inspired by this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3v54ir/indian_nutritional_problems_analyzed/

Much of that post is true, some of it is false.  

In particular, saturated fat does not cause cardiovascular disease.  This is something you see repeated very often on the western internet.  

The cause of cholesterol plaques is subclinical hypothyroidism; thyroid hormones metabolize cholesterol into steroid hormones.  The cause of the hypothyroidism is [the ubiquity of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) in the modern diet](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3gm4nnaudnE/TlGK3y1X0uI/AAAAAAAAA0U/YPMc-DJeMKQ/s1600/LA+in+human+fat+2011.jpg), which directly inhibit oxidative metabolism, and encourage inefficient glycolysis.  

Several years ago, I began taking omega 3 pills, and a few months afterward I started getting hair loss, as well as liver spots forming on my hairline.  I also became very light sensitive, and needed sunglasses everywhere.  I chanced upon the following article:  

http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/fishoil.shtml

It addressed both the liver spots (lipofuscin) and the light sensitization problems I'd been having, so I decided that the author knew something about omega 3s that most others did not.  

I started reading the rest of Peat's work, and would occasionally give one of his guidelines a try, and I would only see drastic improvement every time I did.  **I highly recommend reading and understanding the articles, and experimenting to see what changes work best for you.**  

**Problems with the Indian diet:**  

- High in PUFA oils (antimetabolic)
- High in legumes and other fermentable fibrous vegetables (promote bacterial growth, which produces endotoxin, which elevates estrogen)
- Vegetarian (missing key nutrients like zinc, selenium, B vitamins, adequate protein, gelatin)

**Things that have personally helped a lot:**

- Ceasing consumption of all fermentable fibers.  Basically, I don't eat anything that gives me any amount of gas.  The only vegetables I eat are bamboo shoots and raw carrots.  I eat mushrooms as well.  
- Vitamin K2.  This vitamin is needed for proper calcium deposition.  When I took it, my jaw got wider, my hair grew back, my facial hair got softer, and my anxiety disappeared.  Highly recommend.  
- Taking a big shit every day.  Your fecal matter contains toxins excreted through the bile, as well as toxins produced by enteric bacteria.  The faster you can get feces out of your large intestine, the better.  
- Coffee helps a lot with taking big shits very regularly, and is healthful otherwise.  
- Raw carrots are very good at relieving anxiety, because they are antibacterial, and thus indirectly anti-estrogenic.  Also a good source of fiber which cannot be fermented (because it is antibacterial)
- Gelatinous soups/broths, made from pig feet, chicken feet, lamb bones, etc.  
- Avoiding all PUFA.  This means avoiding ALL oils except for coconut oil, palm oil, and olive oil.  Almost 100% of restaurant food and street food is cooked in PUFA oil, so functionally this means a lot of eating at home.  This also means avoiding foods that contain these oils as major constituents (most nuts, avocados, etc.: check if you're unsure)

**What I might eat and do in a day:**

- Coffee in the morning, with sugar and cream
- Defecate
- Eggs and orange juice for breakfast (protein should be eaten with sugar)
- Rasmalai (ricotta cheese/milk/saffron/cardamom with plenty of sugar)
- 1 mg Vitamin K2, 1000 IU Vitamin D, depending on when I last took these, and how I feel at the moment.  I don't supplement daily, and I depend on butter for Vitamin A.  
- Ripe bananas
- Steak cooked in butter, with rosemary/thyme/white wine",Food,False,0.57,"['[deleted]', 'I took you seriously until you said ""toxins.""

I am fed up of India.,3.0,4ahuk9,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ahuk9/i_am_fed_up_of_india/,25.0,"Hello there. I hope that the moderators here do not remove this topic, thread, I don't really know what it is called. I hardly post here and I usually just lurk on this subreddit. I am really bad at typing these paragraphs but I will give it a go. 

For the past few months, I have been thinking about this a lot. India has been a very terrible experience for me. I live in Chandigarh which is considered to be one of the most developed cities in our country which is a joke, this city is terrible when compared to the cities in the western countries. The rest of India is way worse, when a person who lives in one of the most ""developed"" cities of a country says that the city is very bad due to the infrastructure available then that's a real shame for the government. There's not a single thing I like about this country (except for the food, I love it) at all, I read the news daily in hopes of reading something which shows that our country is finally developing but no, all I see is news that depresses the hell out of me. The worst thing is that this news doesn't even show the full picture, many things still happen and we don't even know about them at all. Fine, every country has their secrets, so does India. No matter where I go, all I see is filth and terrible infrastructure. I cringe whenever my relatives and friends say ""Hey, look, a new house is being constructed! Development!"" I am not sure if this happens with everybody else. I am not an expert at this but if a house is being built in a place with the worst infrastructure possible, that doesn't mean development. Instead, you're making the situation worse because it would have to be destroyed for constructing something (in case that happens which is impossible). India's government is one of the most inefficient governments I have ever seen, getting work done here is a blessing. I see people posting on this subreddit thinking their opinions actually matter (I know whatever I am saying is an opinion too but I wanted to let it all out), people sending e-mails to TRAI, etc. thinking there will be a change. Even if there's a change, will it make our country any better to be honest? Most redditors here think that they're different from the rest of the country, let me tell you, it's the contrary. All I see is stupid arguments about governments, Modi, Arvind Kejrival, etc. which doesn't help us in anyway. You are literally spending an hour arguing with a person you will never meet in real life. Even if you do win the argument, will it really make any difference? 

My blood boils whenever I see a poor person on the streets because I am unable to help him/her, there are millions of these people. Hell, even we are poor when compared to the people in the western countries. I look at China and see how much they have developed and look at where India is, it's a huge shame for the government. I always notice false hope in the news, people keep living in India thinking that the country will change in a good way, no, it won't. At least not in a couple of decades (I am being extremely optimist here), there would have to be a huge change in the way how the government works to actually achieve any important infrastructural development. I don't really understand why people say that India is diverse and then say it is a good thing. Yes, people from different religions living in a country is a nice thing but do you see what's happening in India? Bloodshed, I would rather live a country with just one religion than a country with 5-6 religions, it only leads to conflicts.
The education system in India is an absolute joke, all I see is students cheating recklessly to score marks and even if they do, they don't succeed in their lives. It's all about the theory, many of my relatives didn't know how to do a job because they just used to cram books. The worst thing I have seen is that whenever we refer to India (before 1947), we forget about Pakistan and Bangladesh. They were also a part of the independence struggle but nowadays, I even see the educated folks insulting them. Just because they're now in a different country? I still consider them Indian, I go to various sites and I see people mocking Pakistan. Many of my relatives are still in Pakistan and I am from Pakistan myself (I am a Sikh). It just feels really bad when I see everybody insulting the people of our own country, the ones of the same origin as us. 

This may sound a  bit far-fetched but Pakistan and India are the same for me, not because of the culture or anything but because of the violence. It doesn't matter how people die, whether they die in terrorist attacks or andolans (protests), people are still dying. My great-grandmother used to say that India will once be as developed as the western countries. Well, I will have to say that she would have been extremely disappointed if she was still alive. I often travel to cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar, etc. and I see that many of the buildings are there since the time of independence, they're still in the same condition. India is changing, you are correct about that but in a bad way (infrastructure-wise at the very least). Okay, let's say that I should forget about the infrastructure, we still need to improve a lot when it comes to our own homes. The internet speed is terrible, the power-cuts and brownouts are terrible, the water is terrible, there's nothing good to point out. If India really wants to change then we will have to destroy a lot of buildings, etc. and start from scratch, all of these houses which are being built feel temporary to me because they don't constitute development at all. The road in front of my house is a 2-lane road, whenever people come to our house, they are shocked to see such a wide road. This thing alone makes me very sad because people in the western countries are used to having a 4-lane road (or more) in front of their houses.
This world isn't fair at all, what did I do to deserve to be born in such a country? I know I am offending everybody but this is the truth. We are all helpless, there's nothing we can do. People keep chanting ""Swacch Bharat!"" but it doesn't mean anything because picking up a few packets of Kurkure, Lays chips, etc. which are lying on a really poorly built road won't help much.

As far as I can tell, India will stay the same, even if it does change, it will take a lot of time and I'd rather not spend that time in this country. I am going abroad as quickly as I can but I don't think I can because my parents don't want to leave India. I am sorry if I offended any of you guys with this but I always see people complaining about something here, thinking that there can be a change. Sadly, there won't be a change. India is totally fucked. It's going to implode any time, in fact, it already is (thanks to all of these stupid riots, protests, etc.). India's too far gone. 

If I were you, I would have left the country long ago. I want to love my country and respect it but I can't respect a country where 99.99% of the population is still living in shitty conditions. 

I hope the best for India.

"No, all Indians don't condone rape and india is not a sick society. India should protect her both culture and image while making progressive changes towards the 21st century.",0.0,2y6eeg,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2y6eeg/no_all_indians_dont_condone_rape_and_india_is_not/,0.0,"It needs to be said that there are some historical factors that contributed to the situation in Delhi and other places in India where rapes have occurred. No doubt that rape is very disgusting, unfair and sickening but we can't forget that India is still trying to recover culturally from invasions by Islam and England that lasted over centuries with traumatic damage to its inherent reasoning, economy and physical landscape. It is a post-colonial society.

The Muslims were especially terrible on the North side of India (where the brutal rape occurred) and they had a habit of enslaving and treating people with general disrespect so Indians adapted a more defensive tone against their women for protection, thus birthing the oppressive instinct lingering ever since on the north side. Indian women have become more liberal recently however (More power to them!) and the brutal rape was a terrible reaction by the four idiots in Delhi to their perceptions of freedom which was considered taboo or insulting in the north side. I'm truly happy that two of the rapists have been put to death and the last two will be soon. Indian women have been known to enjoy more openness in society towards the South of India because the Muslims did not invade that far and denigrate the culture.

India was also made extremely poor by the British and they wreaked havoc on the social fabric of the entire subcontinent by creating motivations for the caste system and turning the different clans against one another while justifying it as a rigid vertical hierarchy (which it originally was not) with bigger rewards for those at the top. Plus England was responsible for the British East India Tea company and as a whole, they looted the entire continent of its resources and then used that money to further colonize the rest of the world to our chagrin today... India was not called Britain's crown jewel for no reason! And yes, the British East Tea company was supposedly run by a psychopath. 

My final point is that India is still trying to recover (as it has many times before) from the negative aspects of its colonial history and its lingering side effects but Indians are still making progress in their own right. If Indians and everyone else would actually look further back throughout its history; then they would see India's amazing proto-cultural, intellectual and proto-spiritual developments that have existed even before the first monotheistic faith (Zoroastianism) stepped foot on the Earth. In other words, India is still the enduring legacy of an ancient civilization crucial to world development; and no, it did not get there by disrespecting it's women- it was however an arbiter of trade in the silk roads, invented the number 0 in mathematics and calculated the age of our planet as billions of years old (similar to modern scientific thought) when no one else even considered such things. It is also the place and culture where yoga and meditation came into existence that we enjoy today in the west so please don't judge India or Indians based on any British perspective about rape because England has already enslaved and pillaged the majority of the world's cultural identity and resources (which is also a form of rape if you truly think about it...)

Please don't misunderstand though, rape is not OK and there is a need for a continuing line of Indian progress/recovery within its own country but Britain does not deserve the right to evoke an isolated emotional reaction in absence of the objective world history that it has negatively contributed to in terms of culture; so please research everything, don't fall for emotional propaganda and always keep questioning!

Let the truth prevail...

He's arguing as a secularist and for the separation of the state from religion. This means that Hindus must not use the government to promote their religion. But it also means that the government cannot have control over the administration of Hindu temples (when it doesn't have similar authority over churches or mosques), or have quotas or subsidies for religious minorities.

It is rooted in Indian soil and regards India as sacred, but Hinduism has an extensive history beyond the boundaries of India. When proponents of Hindutva conflate being of Indian origin with being Hindu, they entirely neglect the ten million or so Hindus in Indonesia and even those few thousand indigenous Hindus in Vietnam. They forget that Hinduism was once the dominant religion of Southeast Asia. It didn't need India or 'Indian culture' (as if it's some rigid, monolithic entity) to survive, or flourish.\n\nIndian Hindus have drawn within themselves, as if into a cocoon, and forgotten that there are, and have been for thousands of years, indigenous Hindus in other parts of the world.

The article is basically implying that because of free transport in metros, women’s workforce will increase exponentially.', 'Economist here. This isn\'t the field I directly work in, but I\'ve covered it in parts of my research work, etc. \n\nIt absolutely makes sense in theory, and most practical hurdles can be overcome with (and this is the biggest issue) good-willed political backing. Note that this is true for practically any major economic policy. I\'ll break down my reasoning by discussing the criticisms themselves (ignoring the more banal ones like \'this is just an election gimmick\'). I\'m building up on some of the defenses already raised by AAP members, but going deeper into the economics of them. \n\n**Criticism 1: ""How does making it free for women help safety? Cost was never an issue for people travelling in the metro!""**\n\nThe reality is that the fee hike that happened last year definitely priced out a chunk of people who would have otherwise traveled by the metro, and even the earlier cost priced out a chunk of people who could have otherwise used it to commute. Removing this barrier to entry will mean that when presented with two options, one of which is a measurably safer mode of travel (the Metro, government buses), cost won\'t be a factor. You need to think not about the upper class but the lower class.\n\n**Criticism 2: This is just a waste of public funds! Delhi Metro will run at a loss! Quality will reduce!**\n\nIt\'s not. At least, not necessarily. Firstly, last I read, women currently only comprise about 25-30% of the transport, so it\'s not like the revenue will halve. Secondly, the Delhi Government has already indicated that it will compensate DMRC from its own budget. Does the Delhi Government have enough money? It theoretically does. Delhi has a lot of tax and non-tax revenue as a major city, so it can afford to spend on public goods like free/subsidized public transport. There are a lot of untapped sources also (the Nirbhaya Fund is almost never spent, for instance).\n\nAnd the article discusses the idea of negative externalities, which is extremely relevant. Encouraging public transport is cheaper in the long run than encouraging private transport, so taking a loss here doesn\'t mean that there won\'t be indirect economic benefits. This is the principle behind making all public transport subsidized/free. \n\nRegarding quality, please don\'t forget that the Delhi Metro is ranked amongst the best in the world. People constantly think of the Kolkata Metro as the natural conclusion to subsidies, but that was a result of mismanagement and lack of investment, not just artificially keeping prices low. \n\n\n**Criticism 3: What about men?**\n\nMost men will not have their travel restricted by their family because of safety, and are not as price-sensitive when it comes to using transport as women. While it would be best if their concerns could be addressed right now also, the perfect public policy does not exist and this is probably the best that can be done right now. If your concern is more MRA/""we should be fair"" etc, then I can point you to some useful feminist literature. \n\nIn an ideal world, the metro would be heavily subsidized/free for everyone. Sadly, this is a world that still hasn\'t shaken off the notion of neoliberalism, austerity, and the myth of free market efficiency and homo economicus.', 'People would start riding the metro just to enjoy the AC back and forth.

Kabir Singh - Sadist Horny Sexist Objectifying Women,5.0,c4r90x,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4r90x/kabir_singh_sadist_horny_sexist_objectifying_women/,18.0,"## To all the Randians ranting about Kabir Singh,
I don't understand why Kabir Singh is being judged by Randians!. 
Firstly, to those prying about the story killing the concept of consent and romance, I guess you have been so brainwashed by Bollywood movies and soap opera where the male protagonist ALWAYS TAKES CONSENT before kissing her and DOESN'T SING a song ABOUT HER PHYSICAL BEAUTY, EMBARRASSING HER IN PUBLIC, that you judge a raw and wild portrayal of a character.
Is Kabir Singh HORNY and OBJECTIFIES WOMEN? He never stalked a women, never commented on a women, no booing, no cat calling even before meeting his first and last love Preeti. No whistling the lady and shouting her name. no getting into fights just to show his masculinity and impress her. Who are you to judge how two people in a relationship behave with each other.

Another radian was very upset that movie had a scene where the hero tries to cut a women's dress with knife. According to this person KABIR SINGH is SADIST< RAPIST. I guess maybe the Redditor failed to realise that women(married) apparently wanted to sleep with the doctor who treated her husband. And NO the hero doesn't drag her into it. Maybe the Redditor doesn't get wild intercourse or foreplay. She brings UP and Bihar and I am really glad she brought up that. I wonder if she has watched Bhojpori movies. People like these are only worthy of the stereotype love stories where the hero is a scum who lives on the street, never been to college, shames the heroine by singing a song on her fairness, dances and forces her to dance or wait as soon as he sings she joins him to dance being impressed, and fights with the goons.

Bottom line I think it's RIDICULOUSLY STUPID AND DUMB to tag all those anti-rape feminist tags to a character who didn't judge her girlfriend being pregnant and still wanted to marry her. Who became a maniac on realising she got married. Who was so crazy for her to give-up home, defy his father rather than moving on. Those who think the hero slapping his girlfriend as a decimation of feminism, fail to recognise his unconditional love and probably has never been in a relationship where the guy and girl are crazy about each other.",Non-Political,False,0.53,"['Bhai tu hi hain target audience.

It might relieve some people of paying electricity and water bills today however, the future the generation will suffer unemployment and lack of competitive resources thanks to policies you are perpetuating.

Aam Aadmi Party was supposed to be a party with a difference, but even AAP has decided to play politics. In the short sightedness of increasing a vote bank the party is going to kill the economy of the state. People are not fools to not see through this.

Instead of free water, free electricity, free roads, free security shouldn't you/ AAP be concentrating to empowering people to pay for those facilities rather than making them beggars(people getting services for free). How to empower people is by creating jobs. Jobs given on the basis of merit not caste/senoirity/political agenda.

Why shouldn't the South secede?,7.0,8usph2,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8usph2/why_shouldnt_the_south_secede/,195.0,"Why shouldn't the United States of South India happen? The south is leaps and bounds ahead of the North in every way possible. The social indicators of the South like birth rate and even sex ratio are close to western EU standards.But the North have around 10 times worse rates.Economically, cities like Bangalore, Mumbai,Hyderabad and Chennai would have easily been cities of the size of NY,London and other HUGE cities in the world and they would be held to the same standard as well. I'm not going to deny that the South isn't perfect but a lot of the problems would have been solved if the South separated and dealt with it. As it is,there are place like the South Canara district which are so aware and educated that political parties can't put the usual crooks and idiots up for election because the people will actually vote for NOTA.

Aside from developmental purposes, the South is also culturally different from the North. And the people from North realised it was better staying in the south because of climate, job opportunity etc and now the number of north Indians are so huge in the south.Why is this a problem? They try and impose Hindi in a way, their families might have lived here for 10-20 years and they will hardly know a few words in the regional language.They expect everyone to speak Hindi with them even though over here English is probably more common than Hindi and is usually 2nd behind the local language.Other than this, they also brought the problems the North had in terms of social indicators here.

If you ask most people, I can guarantee they will say that Hindi is the national language of the country even though we have around 30 national languages, if you look at the country as a whole and not just by population, English is far more popular. When the country was formed after independence, the makers of the constitution convinced the southern states to join by promising them that the culture of the North wouldn't be imposed and made rules to accommodate this. Despite this the people continue to ignore our culture, lifestyle and values and expect everyone to follow them.

There is absolutely no reason the South should continue to be a part of the country. the country has fucked the South and expect to continue to live off the South's work and success.

I know this seems like a rant which it is to some extent (I saw an article that said a tourist was raped in Delhi and the govt says that they have no problem ensuring safety of women in the country. This is obviously a lie and they aren't even trying to deal with the problem.This happens in the south, not gonna deny but personally I feel more people here know why this crime has to be stopped and are willing to help while in my visits to the north the people itself, barring a few who are more educated and exposed to other culture, do not understand the problem. There are still towns where the govt knows families have children till they get a male child and kill all the female babies and do nothing about it because they don't see a reason to stop it), but honestly why should the South stay a part of the country? Are there people who are truly from the south who believe that there is no merit to exit?

The myth of 'jobless growth',11.0,387vad,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/387vad/the_myth_of_jobless_growth/,25.0,"http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jobless-growth-no-more/article5919426.ece?homepage=true
[Article from April 2014]

- Between 2009-10 and 2011-12, non-agricultural employment grew rapidly.
- Between 1999-2000 to 2004-2005, the number of non-agricultural jobs created was 7.5 million per annum.  
- Between 2004-2005 and 2011-12 again, the number of non-agricultural jobs created was 7.5 million per annum.  

- The important point is that millions left agricultural work after 2004-05 on account of many new opportunities. Although 37 million persons left agriculture during the periods 2004-05 and 2011-12, they found work in non-agricultural activities, both rural and urban. In comparison, 20 million new workers joined agriculture between 1999-2004.

- Agriculture has grown much faster since 2005. In fact, during the 11th Plan, agricultural output grew at 3.2 per cent per annum (2007-12) on average, despite crippling drought in 2009-10 and despite the number of people leaving agriculture.  
- The reduction of people working in agricultural work is the first time in our history.   
- Services jobs grew by 11 million, and manufacturing employment increased by a remarkable nine million in two years alone (2009-10 and 2011-12), although manufacturing employment fell in absolute terms by three million between 2004-05 and 2009-10. 

- For the first time in the history of India, there was a decline in the absolute numbers of the poor after 2004-05; until then for nearly 30 years (1973-74 to 2004-5), there was a fall in the percentage, but not in the absolute numbers of the poor (322 million poor in 1973-74 and 302 million poor in 2004-05, by the Lakdawala poverty line). The decline in poverty was driven by a rise in real wages.  
- The new non-poor demand simple manufactured consumer goods: processed food (biscuits, milk), leather goods (shoes, sandals), furniture (plastic chairs/tables, wooden furniture), textiles, garments and mobiles. All these product areas and services saw a dramatic increase in employment between 2009-10 and 2011-12, primarily because these simple, low-end products (at least those consumed by the new non-poor) are produced in the unorganised sector, using labour-intensive methods.

There is lot of action on the ground.

* Increased taxes on petrol by around 8-10%. Petrol now costs more than aviation fuel.
* Increased service tax.
* Cleaned India on one particular day last year. It became so clean that it hasn't needed any cleaning since then. There is a plan to levy a 2% tax on everything to do this photo op annually.
* Got a nuclear treaty signed with US. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this for 7-8 years.
* Increased Foreign Investment in insurance to 51%. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this.
* Increased train fares. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this inspite of the railways being subsidised heavily and running at a loss.
* Put Modiji's photo on tea cups used in Railways.
* Allowing Foreign investment in retail. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this.
* Got clean chits for some party members (including the head of his party) who were facing criminal cases in the courts.
* Appointed a TV serial actress who dropped out of school at 17 as the head of our Education ministry.
* IIT Delhi Director resigned. Chairman of Board of Governors of IIT, Bombay resigned. Delhi University Vice Chancellor resigned.
* Arranged a 1 billion $ loan from a Government bank for the guy who provided him with aircraft and copters for his campaigning.
* Trying to push a GST bill through parliament. This is the same bill Modiji had opposed for 12 years when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
* Went full steam ahead on a National ID card project which he had criticised the previous government for heavily.
* Did Biryani politics with Pakistan.
* Renamed several programs of the previous government and relaunched them as new programs.
* Took credit for a few achievements of the previous government.
* The previous government had deregulated petrol prices. But the new government now controls deregulated fuel prices by tweaking taxes on petrol so that the price at the pump is regulated.
* Pressurized Governors appointed by Previous Government to resign. Those who didn't were transferred to whatever is the Indian equivalent of Siberia. Mizoram has seen 7 Governors in 8 months because of this.
* Announced India as an unstoppable force in Science by leaking out the fact that India invanted plastic surgery, planes and inter galactic travel.
* Appointed the kind of censor board committee which made us miss Leela Samson and her gang.
* Gave Padma Bhushan to the founder of the TV channel which is the pride of India - IndiaTV.

But Modiji's presidency shouldn't be just seen at the national level. His party has also done several great things at the state level.

* Banned beef in Maharashtra. You can be jailed for 5 years if you are caught with beef.
* They have a cow ministry in Rajasthan.
* Cows are going to be issued Aadhaar National ID cards in Rajasthan. Hoof Prints may be used for biometric authentication.
* Cows may also be provided photo id cards in Maharashtra.
* Religious Hindu texts to be made as mandatory study in schools in Haryana.
* No FIRs against bureaucrats, MLAs in Maharashtra with prior approval from the Government.
* Moving towards Doordarshan autonomy in Gujarat. One guy who reported news about Jashodaben's RTI application was transferred to the Andamans.
* Reservation for Marathas in Maharashtra. Aren't even an unprivileged community.

However, saying that just because it failed we should give up on our space missions altogether is grossly myopic. \n\nIt took NASA several failed missions before they were able to land a man on moon. Such missions are extremely complex and no matter how much you prepare you can’t eliminate the risk completely. Even Israel, which you would agree is far ahead of us in tech failed to land a rover on moon. However, just because you fail  once doesn’t mean you give up. You learn from the mistakes and improve. That’s how science progresses, \n\nAs for ISRO, it’s track record has actually been far better than most space agencies. Almost all it’s satellite launch missions have been a success and it is one of the most efficient players in the field. So much so that most foreign companies too now consider ISRO a preferred launch partner. So more missions will help ISRO become even more efficient by improving its tech. \n\nTalking of the economics, ISROs budget is peanuts in the larger scheme of things. ₹10k crores is nothing in budgetary terms. Even Chandrayaan was the cheapest mission of its kind pursued by any country. And see this money as money wasted cause a missions failed. Think of this money actually being spent on infra, just that this infra is space infra. This money creates jobs for scientists, gives employment to workers who work in factories that provide parts for the rockets or construct the launch pads etc. Further, if ISRO is able to master manned space flight, it opens to India doors of space tourism, an industry that is being actively explored by companies across the world and has potential of billions of dollars. Also ISRO is actually profitable, in its commercial satellite operations at least.\n\nAnd more than the economics, you should see the social impact of these missions. It incentivises hundreds of scientists of pursue this filed, inspires countless students. It fosters scientific temperament among people. You can’t really put a price tag on these things and they reap themselves later. If America hadn’t given this push to science back then maybe there would have been no Silicon Valley today.\n\nAnd lastly, strategically too space exploration is crucial.

I would give examples, but I will assume you are smart enough to think of hundreds on your own.\n\nAs for whether space missions are inherently useless, I don't think so at all. But are they relatively useless in a country like ours, where basic infrastructure is severely lacking? I am not sure at all, because if all the money allocated over the years actually went into its designated place, we would have been doing quite well.

So please don't downvote and kill this thread without even reading. 
Please convince me and tell me where I am going wrong. 



I see nothing wrong in prohibiting women or men in a particular temple or mosque or church. Or in certain sections of said mosque church temple. 



--Hinduism is made of thousands of different sects, belief systems, ideas etc so much so that if anyone tries to limit it to a set of beliefs like the RSS or. BJP sometimes do.. They will be in the wrong. 


-- This particular sect States that the deity is a celibate and does not want to come in contact with fertile women.

Why should it matter that it is stupid or intelligent or smart or foolish. 

It is a belief. All religious beliefs are man made and stupid according to me. But people are free to believe whatever they want to. This is religious freedom. 

-- As long as nobody is imposing their beliefs on others, and the belief is not causing harm to others...
We should respect it. We can critique it if we want to. But we shouldn't impose our own belief system onto others forcefully. 


-- Now somebody will say that this prohibition is causing harm to women. How? 


If you are a genuine devotee of Lord Ayappa or whatever the lords name is.. And you believe in this particular sect. You will believe that he doesn't want to come in contact with women. So why would any women want to do what the lord specifically did not want them to do. It is like a jain person doing animal sacrifice. Going completely against the basic tenet of the sect. 


That is why no women believing in the sect wants to go there.


And if you don't like this sect and its prohibition of visiting the deity in the temple, then change your sect, change your religion, become atheist...do whatever you want. 


And I don't see any harm if you don't get to go to this particular temple where the deity specifically wishes you not come. 


Go to other temples man. Or pray from the base of the temple or whatever. 


-- But what if I want to reform the religion, one might ask. I want to have a lord ayappa sect which welcomes women to touch the deity and take selfies with deity etc etc. Or whatever reform one wants to have. 


So start your own temple. Your own sect. Nobody is stopping you. If somebody stops you, then they will be wrong, and I will fight for your right to your religious freedom. 


Start your own lord ayappa sect and add many other idols of women around it. Make it only for women. Do whatever it is that you want to. Preach your new sect. 


For example- Homosexuality is prohibited in all abrahamic religions. 
A gay person cannot become the leader of a mosque or a church (technically).


You cannot force Delhi Jama Masjid or Kalkaji Church to allow a gay person to become the imam or the pastor who will lead the prayer. This is against religious freedom. 


But at the same time, gay Muslims and Christians can open up lgbt mosques and churches and welcome all people there. 


Gay Imam in LGBT friendly mosque in South Africa 
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-lgbt-religion-idUSKCN1PU0J9




-- Forcing your own belief systems onto religious sects and beliefs is wrong and stupid. 


If there is a bali sect among Hindus where goats and cattle are sacrificed, it is improper for other vegetarian Hindus to force them to stop their balis. 


And more so for the judiciary to meddle into the affairs of religion. 


You can try and reform. You can try and convince. You can start your own counter sect. But you cannot force.

They are not imposing their beliefs on others, they are not forcing other women to visit the temple. They are not harming anyone with their belief. Then why impose your beliefs on them and restrict them from visiting the temple?\n\nYou cannot equate this situation to a gay person being appointed as a pastor or an imam.

An Estimate of Bhai's size. [NP],0.0,3ntfq2,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ntfq2/an_estimate_of_bhais_size_np/,17.0,"Hi friends, yesterday night I saw a bunch of crazies comment on how Salman got robbed. Now I don't know why you idiots call him 'Bhai' or think he is a virgin? Most of the parent comments were about his virginity and they got upvoted without even wondering if his claims of virginity were true?

Anyway, I wondered why four girls would rob him and why he would be reluctant on filing a complaint? I mean, naturally girls take selfies and do tweets and get the hell out of there. But no, not this time, it could only mean one thing, that your 'BHAI'  had sex with all the four girls and one of them took his wallet as a souvenir. And that could  be the only  reason he didn't file a complaint.

But then I wondered how big is his dick that four girls would give themselves up so easily? I did Google searches and found no info on Bollywood actor's dick sizes. There's an abundance of info on Hollywood actor's dick sizes but not Bollywood. For example take *Ashton Ketchup*, he rants on Two and Half Men about how big his dick is, but in reality it's small. No wonder he married Mila Kunis, I mean that's the closest he'll get to an Asian! Were as, take Liam Nesson, it is said that once  a hooker dropped her wine bottle and ran upon seeing his dick.

But no info about Bhai's dick. So I took it upon myself to find out! The average penis size of us Indians is below 4 inches. So Bhai damn sure had to have a bigger dick than the rest of us. I mean, he needs it to slap his co-stars with it!

So I went and googled images of Bhai. And if you see here in this [album](http://imgur.com/a/9tHW2), you'll see that Bhai always has a bulge. It means that he has a big dick and is not just a *shower* but also a *grower*. 

Who else has a bulge like him? [BECKHAM](http://imgur.com/D2vxCBD), and Beckham is disputed to have a dick upwards of 8 inches, so Bhai too has a dick that big, if physics and common sense is applied here. 

They say women know about a man  the moment they lay their eyes on them. Those four poor girls were just a victim of greed. The saw his dick and couldn't control themselves.  

Now why has Bhai not been able to sustain a relationship? It could only mean two things, they are as follows:  

* As Bhai got older and wiser, his thirst for better sex didn't stop either. And no one women could have satisfied him!

* Or, he, like we see in Media is very aggressive and volatile and may have fetishes like BDSM. In his endeavours of BDSM, Bhai probably went to harsh and rough on them and therefore his relationships ended.

So to sum up, Bhai has a dick in the size range of **8-8.5 inches** (twice the country's average) and this is the reason why he displays such charismatic and confident behavior on T.V.

* 1 Indian people quietly loathe, but accept the fairness mania.. everyone literally thinks it's OK to look at fairness as an attractive quality when choosing a husband/wife/boyfriend/girlfriend. 

You know we can't change our genotypes right? We will always be brown, or dark brown.

* 2 Indians put the language of the oppressive british regime, English, as one of the ""national"" languages. The ""good schools"" are christian schools with emphasis on english. 

Sure, the tamils don't speak hindi... then why not LEARN hindi instead of english. (hindi is closer to tamil as a language than english).

ENGLISH IS A NECESSARY LANGUAGE TO BE FLUENT IN, but it isn't required to be your primary language. (look at germany, japan, france, sweden..etc).

* 3 Many Indian Moslims think they're not even ""Indian"" ethnically. They believe they apparently are descended from ""arabs/persians"". (maybe 5% of them are... but this thinking is frighteningly more wide-spread than 5%)

* 4 Some Indian Christians tend to try to be more ""english"" or ""american"" RATHER THAN ""christian"". (I said some, not all) 

* 5 Many Hindus hate their scriptures, religion. Yes, many scriptures are clearly frightening (some puranas). But have you read a book as open-minded and philosophically rich as the Gita? or the ISA upanishad?

Police said so far 98 have succumbed and around 40 more are under treatment in various government and private hospitals since the past four days.

The tragedy occurred after scores of slum residents in Malwani, a northern suburb, bought and consumed methanol-infused hooch from local bootleggers. The concentration of toxic methanol in the hooch was high enough to send more than a hundred consumers to the hospital with complaints of breathlessness, stomach aches and failing vision. The death toll is now higher than that of Mumbai’s last major hooch catastrophe in 2004, when 89 people had died in Vikhroli.

Want all bollywood movies to be full of neorealistic / parallel cinema, but absolutely adore sci-fi from hollywood eg - ""Deadpool is so great. #niceCock""



2. Want some movies to be realistic, don't care about others. Example - want to see all reality in fun bollywood movies, but like movies like ""Udta Punjab"" because yeah fucking Tommy Singh is totally real.



3. See acting by actors in low budget cinema, but not in mainstream cinema. Example - Everyone is talking about FAN is this, fan is that. Some hate it, but the people who hate it have not praised SRK's acting or even talked about it. ""The film sucks because I want the story of a homosexual villager but I am getting a much more entertaining movie instead #IamTheBestCritic"".



4. Rating acting on physical work by the actor. 

Example - There are thousands of ""intelligent"" janta on fb and even here who are like ""OMG Hooda has lost 18kg weight in 28 days. GIVE HIM THE NATIONAL AWARD #IloveJaatCock"". Fuck you! Award because he lost weight to look malnutrished? The work done by people like Salma, Hrithik, SRK and other stars on their bodies to look good is nothing?



5. Pre made opinions on the movie by the name of actors.

Example - Anurag Kashyap, Nawazuddin, Paresh Rawal, etc.

I saw this on fb. ""Raees is going to be great because Nawaz signed it, that's why others are doing good""

However, here's the thing.               \nBlockbuster bollywood movies are shit without even a cherry on top. The industry is filled with people you can *loathe*, shit, bollywood people can be the next zombies/nazis in fpses. There's people with shit eating grins on their fucking faces sucking off Salman Khan, a manslaughterer because monaay!                                \nPeople like you will defend the kind of nepotism and corruption(Not to mention the entire black money laundering operation for Mumbai mafia thing) in Bollywood.

Where'd you learn logic? The Rohit Shetty institute of Physics?"", ""1. I expect a movie to be as it is advertised. Eg. Nobody watching *Deadpool* trailer/promotion should have any doubt about the kind of movie it is, and it delivered on them. By being funny, uncharacteristically honest, and extremely true to its origin(comics). OTOH, many Bollywood movies are advertised with realistic story/characters/action and deliver none. Eg. Ra.one, krrish. \n\n2. Similar to 1. Deadpool is expected to be unrealistic been cause that's what it's genre is and how it's advertised. *Fault in our Stars* is not expected to be unrealistic because it's genre/promotion is different. Theovoe doesn't lie about its nature before release. A great example I like is with *Wanted*,*Dabang*,*Dabang 2*. First 2 were advertised comedy action and delivered. Last was advertised with great realistic action, excellent story and turned out it had neither.\n\n3. For all the worth they have proven, unfortunately, three biggest names in industry (a.k.a. Khans) have disappointed almost universally and consistently for past few years. At the same time, small budgeted movies have proven to be excellent while expected nothing of, like *Lunchbox*. People tend to shift their attention/devotion to things that turned up profit(quality) on investment(tickets).\n\n4. No one is rejecting hardword by actors to get buffed up. But you must realise, it takes equally brutal work/devotion to reduce weight. Reducing weight by that much in that less time means living on an apple a day. Try it someday and you'll realise how hard that is, then imagine living off if that while doing everything else like nothing changed.\n\n5. Of course, people form opinions if there is no variation in one's work over years. You hear *Rohit Shetty* and of course you think flying cars, stretched out comedy, and action scenes with high frequency sounds, heavulky drumed up songs with large crowds. People think Nawazuddin/Irrfan/Paresh Rawal to have performed well because they have consistently outperformed expectations. No one doubts Amitabh because he has proven even a shitty movie shall have excellent acting by him. Khans, unfortunately have proven to do exactly opposite. Eg.

DAE Think that there is a huge conspiracy underfoot to discredit India.,15.0,3a9bdt,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3a9bdt/dae_think_that_there_is_a_huge_conspiracy/,50.0,"So I am not the kind of person who believes in conspiracy theories, but the turn of events over this year has me broadly convinced that the Indian MSM is working against our interests and there is a larger cabal with sufficient economic resources and a clear agenda driving it. 

I think it all started with the Modi govt. banning NGOs. So, I was one of those who thought that this was a retrograde move. A lot of NGO's do good - I know for a fact that a lot of implicit missionary activities goes on behind the scenes, but I have no problem if people convert to christianity so that they can make bread. The christian missionaries might have ulterior motives - but its still fine with me. The poor of this country are better of with bread and god, than neither. 

I think all this media manipulation started of post this act of hte Modi govt.. When NGO's were pumping money into India, there was a relatively easy channel to 'wake up' our population to the service of Jesus. But the ban on NGO's put water to by and large this act which had been going unhindered for a couple of decades now. The media manipulation that we are seeing now, is partly a response to this act of the Modi govt. and partly a newer and more effective strategy to bring Jesus into our lives. It is this more effective strategy which has rankled me most.

Even though Indians might see themselves a secular country, the world - and by and large the western world, does not. For the west India is broadly Hindu - the failings of India are by and large the failings of Hinduism. The media strategy is amazingly effective because it does not need to direct Hindusim - what it does instead is direct India itself and it is left to the imagination of the audience to make that connect with Hindusim. This, as most marketing gurus will tell you, is one of the most effective marketing ploys. Do not sell water to the thirsty, but glorify the beauty of your wells and let people make that connect in their minds. 

I think it is broadly known that a lot of agencies which funds NGO's in India also have significant interests in the media. Add to that delipidated law and order infrastructure in the country and lot of medieval social/cultural mores still present in parts of the society makes India the perfect hot spot for these kind of shenanigans. A population which is acutely aware of their failings is the perfect ground for the harvesting of souls - the societies which come from Jesus do not have any such social ills and this connect is left for the audience to make for themselves.

The biggest success of this strategy was obviously the delhi rape incident and the documentary behind it. However, I would like to give credit to the home minister Rajnath singh, who acted like a rank amateur here and walked into the trap by banning it. The documentary was shoddily made and it would have died a natural death had it not been for the home minister who is probably the weakest link in the modi govt. However, credit should also be given to NDTV who went on a rampage and raped India in broad daylight. Barkha dutt defending India was either born out of her realisation that her game is being outed and so that she can salvage whatever little credibility is left.

The thing is that this game is not over yet and everyday I am reading news reports which try to play up this angle. There was something on bachelors not getting rents or maybe it was muslims. Then there was the thing about a muslim guy being denied jobs. The thing is that in a country as diverse as India, these things will always happen in a certain number.

The most successful Kings of India were all non Vedic.And the most foolish were Vedic. A Historical recap for Trivedi Goel.,0.0,38i1b7,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38i1b7/the_most_successful_kings_of_india_were_all_non/,26.0,"1) Let us analyse the greatest of Kings of India and abroad and the most foolish of them from pre - medieval and Medeival History.

One thing will be clear globally

1) The Most successful ones were (So to speak Pagans), but they were not Banias (Followers of Vedas, Puranas  or from any Gotra)but independent men who believed in meritocracy.

2)The most foolish ones, the least successful ones were all Vedic.

The backdrop of this analysis is the most basic classification of people. Devas and Asuras. Anyone who followed the Vedic system and adhered to the principles of the Banias and Brahmins were connoted as Devas and the ones who did not were connoted as Asuras as per the more populous Gotras(Then and till today, the combined gotra populations make the Gotra groups of India one of the most widely entrenched, populous and vast social networks of non productive vegetables the planet has ever seen).We can consider the world as a one whole instead of nation states, in that era. We do not analyse prehistory,in a time when Vishnu and Ram and other Vedic Gods did not exist but medieval History. We will pit Human Asuras (So to speak) against Vedic Gods(So to speak) and compare their achievements. 

1) Ram

Genus :  Bania (Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, built no monument, unverified birth location, convinced one group of natives(Marathi monkeys as per Ramayan) to attack a smaller group of natives( South Indians) to avenge the shame of his wife running away with the Richer, Technologically Advanced, Aerial Car Driving Southern King after his wife crossed the Lakshman Rekha. Finally committed suicide after dumping his unchaste wife.(Aum).

2)Parashuram

Genus: Indo Aryan (Bania)
Achievements :  Did nothing,built no monuments, settled some Banias into the southern Lands of Kerala. Murdered his mother who was tempted by Rich native men, unverified existence.

3) Vamana:

Genus :  Dwarf Brahmin ( Indo Aryan), came to Kerala with a group of Brahmins, asked King Mahabali for land and then back-stabbed him by exploding Bania population.

4) Krishna

Genus :  3rd class Indo Aryan(Mixed Blood between Native and Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, instigated war and propounded already well established Cosmic Philosophy from the Sramana system and packaged it well.Built nothing.Died by a hunters arrow.

5) Other small Vedic Fish : Bimbisara, Ajatashatru ..did nothing.

Non Vedic Heroes(Asuras):

1) Ashoka( Native, Bihari) -  Conquered all of Northern India until he converted to Buddhism.

2) Kanishka,(A Kushan King, Non Vedic) - Conquered all of Northern India till the Tarim Basin in Central Asia.

3)Alexander -  Conquered 1/2 the known world.Built Alexandria

4) Genghis Khan - Conquered the World

5)Cyrus the Great -  Conquered the Known World, built Persepolis

6) Ashurbanipal -  Conquered the known world, Built the Largest ancient Library.

7) Nebuchadenezzar -  Conquered the known world, sacked Jerusalem.

8) Sargon of Akkad -  Root for the word, Sarrukin (Now Sharukh Khan), built Sumeria and conquered the known world.

9) Raja Raja Chola -  Conquered from South of India till the Ganges, built Gangai Konda Cholapuram and Brihadeeshwara Temple.

Akbar, Timur and others...not to mention.

We can consistently see why India is poor, because the Vedic people(Devas) and their kings are non inspirational and have noo aspiration and light in them. All they want to do is say Aum and drink milk,play holy with the cows ets and ban eggs in anganwadis. Basically, Goels lives the life of an insect and then come back to live the life of an insect.And India stays, malnourished, backward and poor.For there is noo light in the Vedas.

Anyway, a junior was recommending me Kabir Singh since 1st July, and I was reluctant and hesitant to watch this movie. So today I went and watched this movie.

Rating 2/5...
The cinematography and acting was awesome. Shahid Kapoor's acting was 5/5. I don't have any problem with the misogynistic, drug abusive, violent portrayal of Kabir Singh,because it's just a character. The first half of the movie felt like I was watching something new and refreshing from Bollywood. But things started getting downhill as soon Preeti got married. The story went down the drain, like why was he allowed to perform surgeries in intoxicated states? And he gets punished when he didnt want to perform the surgery but he had no other options, then the logic started going out of the window, suddenly this and that happens, suddenly when he plans to move one, Preeti is conveniently single/seperatee and she didn't even let the other guy touch him. And they get married and Happyzzz Endingzzzz!!! Cliched bollywood. Omg!!! For once why cant they write something different and why are most of the Bollywood's storyline pure garbage??? Like who eats up this shit and doesnt get brain cancer??

CMV: Triple Talaq is a Progressive Law,5.0,5a5273,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5a5273/cmv_triple_talaq_is_a_progressive_law/,61.0,"Triple talaq has been dismissed as medieval and barbaric piece of shitty sexist law and people  supporting it are called creeps.

Wait a minute.....

And what exactly is the other option? Not allowing divorce at all? Feminists talk about consent. Like consent can be granted and then taken back. But when it comes to marriage, once you get married you cannot get out of marriage without the other person allowing to it. 

Considering India where there are loads of arranged marriages and many forced or persons don't exactly know their partners properly, not allowing divorce without partners consent is not exactly progressive. It's just like forced marriages. I haven't seen anyone speak against this oppression of forcing people to stay in marriages. All this talk of banning unilateral divorce for men instead of talking about allowing unilateral divorce for women shows this issue is not about barbaric laws. It's about muslims. 

Triple talaq is just instantaneous unilateral divorce. It's not medieval or barbaric. It's pretty progressive. The only objection which women's rights activists can say against it is that it's available only for men. But when instead of that, when they talk about banning unilateral divorce for men also, I cannot take them seriously. 

Its not just men, Muslim women also have options to end marriage unilaterally. There are already two provisions in the Muslim Personal Law. 

1) Talaq e Tafweez - Delegated divorce. The wife demands right of divorce when getting married. If this right is included in the marriage contract, then she can issue divorce just like triple talaq. Only thing is that it's not included by default. 

2) Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage(Khula) - When the wife cannot tolerate her husband or doesn't like him she can file for divorce. This doesn't require the consent of her husband. Also it's available only under Muslim Personal Law. 

In all other personal laws one cannot get out of marriage without mutual consent. You are forced to stay in marriage against your will. I don't see why nobody is speaking up against such forced marriages?

In fact BJP government dropped the Irretrievable breakdown of marriage for grounds for divorce.

http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-to-make-divorce-easier-may-be-dropped/article6910089.ece


>Groups opposing the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill contend that it will cause an increase in ""illegitimate and live-in relations and thereby a fall of the institution of marriage and family values.""

Since then the Supreme Court has on a number of occasions recommended the inclusion of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce.

BJP does kulcha nonsense and opposes amendment of Hindu law while acting as women's rights activist in case of Muslim personal law.

Hindu Law does not have Triple Talaq, so are you saying that no Hindu women are being divorced? Ironically, one of the defenses of Owaisi and his ilk is that there are many Hindu women being divorced. In fact, he claims 68.8% women being divorced in India are Hindu.

It\'s pretty progressive.\n\nKey words being *unilateral* and *instantaneous*. You cannot call a law serious when it allows separation from SMS, fax machines etc.\n\n>There are already two provisions in the Muslim Personal Law.\n\nCan you provide me statistics of how many marriages are registered with such clauses? Do Mullahs and Qazis inform the women about these rights before the marriage? Are the required by law to do so? (Like Miranda rights or some such). How can we ensure that Muslim women are aware of these rights before marrying? On the other hand if the law was uniform and was not controlled by mullahs, then it would automatically apply to all women without them having to know about these laws (as they are derived from scripture) before hand. \n\n> In all other personal laws one cannot get out of marriage without mutual consent. You are forced to stay in marriage against your will. I don\'t see why nobody is speaking up against such forced marriages?\n\nNo. Hindu women can apply for divorce on the grounds of infidelity, STD, religious differences and cruelty among others. The couples can also chose to separate and after a period of separation they can file for divorce. [Source](https://sites.google.com/site/indiandivorcelaws/grounds-of-divorce-under-hindu-marriage-act-1955). They are not forced by law to stay married. However, what prevents a lot of unhappy couple from separating is societal pressure. They are looked down upon by their family and peers and so may choose to stay together rather than separate.\n\nWhat one cannot do is cite ""Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage"" and as grounds for filing divorce and get divorced quickly. Fair enough, that is a valid criticism. But then by your own admission this right is also not available to Muslim women by default. Only a woman who is well versed in Islamic theology and the convoluted laws setup by AIMPLB would know this.\n\nThis brings us to your final point.\n\n>BJP does kulcha nonsense and opposes amendment of Hindu law while acting as women\'s rights activist in case of Muslim personal law.\n\nLet us limit our discussion here to only Triple Talaq as your post and my comment has. Let us recall the timeline of incidents:\n\n1. Shayara Bano gets divorced in October 2015. Contrary to your rant, she has been abused in her marriage and yet finds she is unable to walk out of it. *She has not asked for UCC or codification of Muslim Personal Law*.\n2. The Supreme Court while hearing other cases asks the Chief Justice to set up a Bench to examine gender discrimination against Muslim women, especially “arbitrary divorce”.\n3. The case snowballs and many other cases add up, which is really strange considering your claim that Muslim Personal Law is the *only* progressive Law in the country.\n4. BMMA, an organisation for Muslim Women Rights, also gets in the fray. It has conducted a [study](https://bmmaindia.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/triple-talaq-report.pdf) that  shows that 92.1% Muslim women want this biased system of verbal triple talaq to stop.\n5. The Supreme Court asked the government of it\'s views. This was unfair as there should be no need for this and I think SC was being a coward.\n6. The govt. replied that it does not support the law.\n\nSo, my question to you is how is this in anyway shape or from related to BJP\'s view of Hindu Divorces? I do not support their views on that (Hindu Divorce, Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage) matter but that is not the question at hand. Why are you involving the BJP in this? It did not file the case. It did not ask the SC to take a look at ""arbitrary divorces"" among Muslims. It was not the primary driving force behind the case. You seem to be deliberately mixing UCC, which is not what this case is about, and Triple Talaq for your own reasons. If UCC comes in, polygyny and Triple Talaq will probably go away but we do not know the contents of the Law are going to be. It has not even been tabled in the parliament, so why are we fighting over that?']",False,True,False,False,False,True

I came out to my parents two years ago. I repent that I didn’t do it any sooner. That’s a different story related to internalised homophobia and bearing extreme shame inside. I used to constantly contemplate taking myself off this earth (not that I still don’t think about it)

My parents are hoping that I might come around and say yes to the Indian societal acceptance of marriage. I am honestly exhausted putting up with my mum. We argue sometimes but more than that I feel MASSIVE guilt. Have I taken their happiness from them? Have I caused shame to my family for what I am? What if people start asking questions when my brother is getting married and me being the elder one is still unmarried? Should I just give up on life where I could be myself and just submit to them and spend my life in a loveless and sexless marriage?

All these questions have been haunting me for the last ten years! I never had any friend that I could trust to tell them that I have been considering suicide for the past year or so, that I have been exhausted of living with myself and the world around me that doesn’t help. I have all of these thoughts inside that are eating me up alive and I feel that hell is inside me.

I feel so alone and dejected in life. All I have ever done in these twenty years is to suck it up all in and never show my vulnerability. All my life I adapted to not feel anything and do everything like I have been told. I get high everyday to drown the sorrow that nobody loves me. I have never had a boyfriend or felt the butterflies! 

Honestly I thought I could move out of the country but that option is looking bleak. I don’t have enough money saved for the move and the depression is getting stronger that I am losing the will to do anything to achieve my dream. There is inherently something wrong with me and I can’t put my finger on it. Travelling is all I wanted to do. But all I can think of is how fucking ugly I am with absolutely no skills to boast for. Like being a useless log that lies in bed all day. 

If this is all there is I would rather pull the trigger soon after I make enough money to support my parents after I am gone. I have nothing to look forward to, life’s a drag and I don’t want to continue the chain of bringing more lives into this ruthless world.

Retaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and Ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation.

 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all.

He has always been a very cheerful and jolly man, almost like my own santa growing up.  During my recent visit in 2016, he was not the same.  He would often come around the village with his grandchildren around his shoulders. This time I would go to visit him, in a small room on the side of the road. The room was connected to the larger family house but there was a sense of isolation and exclusion there. \n\nI think he was alone, away from his family. He had lost about 50 lbs and was not able to communicate any sort of happy expression. He sat up when he saw me but deep down, there was an underlying loneliness I could relate to. It was almost like he was just waiting for the end.\n\nI can relate to that deep sense of not belonging and often try to communicate it through some of my portraiture. It is in many ways baffling to me how we can be moving inward together, at the same time, not knowing we are not going through it alone.  Unfortunately, I feel at times my culture has been a factor in that. Things are often unsaid and misunderstood. I\'ve grown up not knowing how to express internal conflict and struggle because it just wasn\'t something practiced at the family table. Eventually I would like to create enough work for exhibits and to bring some light to issues of mental health to the general public but also to my own culture.   \n\nThe goal of the painting was to portray the overall mood so I started the painting with a large brush to cover the initial layer. 99% of the painting after that was in palette knife. The knife allows me to create movement, texture, and atmosphere in a few sessions instead of having to layer with a brush.', ""I don't know why but this reminds me so much of [this image](http://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Bhagat-Singh-ili-24-img-5.jpg) of Bhagat Singh"", 'Always loved the Punjabi getup and persona, your granduncle and your painting really personified both!

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

&#x200B;

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,2382.0,e69fln,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e69fln/possible_scam_on_the_huge_youtube_tech_channel/,314.0,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today.

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.

It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days.

I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2230.0,ciddbn,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,462.0,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

This makes me happy that the new generation has seen this what I have seen before and have been saying that since 2013. I feel my struggle has been paid off a little whenever I talked about Modi and his fascist intentions since 2013 to everybody. They all laughed at me, I was thinking way too much they told me, I'm crazy and my hate for Modi has taken a fancy ride, they told me.\n\nNow I hope this  at least makes it all clear. You know how people say, once a cop always a cop. Well in Modi's case, once a piece of shit always a piece of shit. I always said Modi can never be this saint suddenly, he has evil intentions when he was brought to the centre of attention by very Desperate Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitely. They were so desperately wanted to win 2014 that they got this fucking terrorist who knows how to polarize and make Hindus hate everybody else. Almost every Senior leaders in BJP opposed that move. Vajpayee hated him to the core, Advani became doubtful and thought Vajpayee is right, other seniors were never in favor of Modi. But Rajnath the mofo as a Party president brainwashed his party's majority who has no clue who Modi was. That and sharp minded evil Jaitely. That was the end of the Seniors of  BJP. Advani should have listened to Vajpayee in 2002 to throw Modi out of the party and everything. If only Advani knew, he wouldn't have had saved Modi.\n\nI knew back in 2013, when Rajnath went to US 3 times to figure out how Modi's 10 years US/UK Ban can be lifted, he wrote 5 letters to the US Republic Senators and others. Also he secretly flew to US to fork out how to get Modi out of the Rioting and Murder charges. It was said that once Modi holds a Diplomatic position, only that can make him move around places. But the Ban cannot be lifted and can be revoked once again once he loses Diplomatic seat. Very plain and simple. Now Modi as he is PM has cleared all his charges as a PM, like how Yogi Adityanath cleared all his charges by being CM. That was the plan by Modi's financers and masters. \n\nA month later SC got Modi's charges cleared, you know that Justice Misra and others and how they did it.\n\nAfter that Rajnath as a Party president liked the idea of IT Cell and went ahead to fund it and created the propoganda machine which makes Modi a Saint and a Savior. That  was the start and rest is now history. And we all tried to tell that to people. They laughed and they thought I was a fool when I said Modi is Hitler back in 2013 and 2014. I never stopped comparing with him, cuz even Hitler came form nowhere and he was just an Officer during WW1. The way Hitler rose by the genius method and support of financers got him his position way up till he rise to power. That was the same way Modi did as followed by Hitler's Fascism #101. Modi wasn't created by himself, tons of money was spent to make his image in every possible way. I've been telling people that all the time. \n\nNow I only pinch myself when the world is saying what I have been saying since 2013. You guys have no idea how in disbelief I am, its making me crazy. I'm losing my mind when I read people now actually call him Hitler.

We had to work as a team to treat efficiently to save every life.”\n\n> I consoled grieving parents who had lost their kids, I counseled those agitated parents who were getting angry after losing their kids. There was so much chaos. I explained them – liquid O2 (oxygen) is finished but we are trying to make it with jumbo cylinders.\n\n> I yelled/screamed to everyone to focus on saving lives. I cried, actually everyone in the team cried, to see the havoc created by the administrative failure to pay the dues to the oxygen suppliers – resulting in such a grave situation.\n\n> We did not stop trying until liquid oxygen tank arrived around 1:30 am on 13-08-2017.\n\n> But my life turned upside down when CM Yogiji Maharaj arrived next morning on 13-08-17.

I swear to my Allah, I did not inform any media person that night. They were already there that night itself.\n\n> Then police started coming to our home – hounding, threatening, torturing my family. People warned they would kill me in an encounter. My family, my mother, my wife, my kids were so scared that I do not have words.\n\n> I surrendered to save my family from the humiliation, misery – thinking when I have not done anything wrong, I should get justice.\n\n> But numbers of days, weeks and months passed – August, 2017 to April, 2018.

But all in vain.\n\n> My daughter whose first bithday I could not celebrate is now 1 year 7 months old. As a pediatrician, it is very painful, disheartening not to see his child to grow. As a pediatrician, I used to taught parents importance of milestones and myself do not know when my daughter started walking, speaking and running.\n\n> So now again that question haunts me – am I really guilty? No, no – NO.\n\n> I was on leave on 10th August 2017. (It was sanctioned by my HoD). Still, I rushed to do my duties – is that wrong?\n\n> They made me head of the department, vice chancellor of BRD, prabhari (in-charge) of 100-bed acute encephalitis syndrome (AEH) ward.

I was nowhere involved with purchase/tender/order/maintenance/supply/payment of liquid oxygen/jumbo cylinders.\n\n> If Pushpa Sales (the official supplier) stopped liquid oxygen supply, how am I responsible for that? Even non medico could tell doctors’ work is to treat, not to buy oxygen.\n\n> The guilty are DM Gorakhpur, DGME (director general of medical education), principal secretary health education for not taking any action against 14 reminders sent by Pushpa Sales for its Rs 68 lakh dues.\n\n> It was a total administrative failure at higher level, they did not realise the gravity and just to save themselves, they made us scapegoat and put us behind the bars so that truth will remain inside Gorakhpur jail.\n\n> When Manish Bhandari (director of Pushpa Sales) got bail, we same same light that may be now we would also get justice and come out to live with my family and to serve again.\n\n> But No – we are still waiting.\n\n> Supreme Court says – bail is the right, prison is exception.

My Covid-19 quarantine experience,1950.0,ffyots,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,158.0,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative

Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.

I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.

The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.

So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.

As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.

In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.

The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.

Now your quest for tension free visa requirements research is over.\n\nHere's why I made this web app:  A year back I became a digital nomad and started traveling. I wanted to visit all the countries that I fancied. Soon I realized that you need a visa to most of these countries, few have VOA(Visa on Arrival) and for others, you have to get it through their embassy in your home country(in my case India). So now I wanted to see the countries I could go without waiting for 3 weeks to get a visa, did some research. After few blogs and websites finally got the list. Traveled to a new country. After few months I wanted to go to another country. I had to do the same search, couldn't find the old one, found a new site which had more countries offering VOA. One of my friends told me that when he researching for Vietnam visa, he found almost 10 websites with .gov and it was really confusing. Many blogs don't have links to official websites of embassies.\n\nTo summarize the problems:\n\n* No aggregated info of visa related info shown in a useful way.\n* Most of the existing blogs and website has very less info and are usually outdated.\n* Lot of research is needed even to go to a single country and this needs to be done every single time.\n* Difficult to find the official website and data on many websites is outdated.\n* Pay more than required money to visa agent's\n\nSo I took the matter into my own hands and decided to aggregate this info, organize and present it in a useful way to the user and so [Visalist](https://visalist.io/india/all-visas/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=india) was born. While I was talking to my friends about this, I realized many people wanted something similar from a long time. So what this has is\n\n* A simple way to find the basic requirements for all the countries you want to travel\n* Simplified visa requirements like visa-free, visa on arrival, visa not required, evisa, visa required and visa refused (Yes! For North Korea)\n* A simple map color-coded with visa requirements across the world so you can easily see which countries around you can easily travel to\n* Visa Requirement details like duration, documents checklist and other requirements for the stay\n* Which is the official website for that information\n\nI coded, designed and built Visa List using VueJS with NuxtJS for the frontend, MySQL for backend using Golang. I was originally an android developer and learned these just to build Visa List.\n\nI believe every person who wants to explore the world around them and would have faced the problem I faced, so could find value in what I have built.

Request: Please treat your office boys and office maids with dignity and respect,1829.0,80toy3,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/80toy3/request_please_treat_your_office_boys_and_office/,281.0,"Good morning everyone

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.

If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 

If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.

Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 

TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.

Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone. 

*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity.

A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply “train is about to come , will miss it” . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her. At last she had to leave and she shouted the words “Idiot bastard” and rushed away shedding her pride. Am I the idiot/bastard in this case ? Why do people get offended when they are being simply told to explain simple rules every citizen has to follow. I know this is very common but I am more offended coz of her retaliation. Also I don’t know why 80% of us don’t speak up against these literate fools who think they have the right to oppress other fellow citizens.

So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel.

Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don't have to transport from earth. \n\nFor ISRO along with all this, it's the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.\n\nEdit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.\n\nEdit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:\n\nBecause we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.\n\nIf you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it's too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important.

"[R] Please don't get Jio Gigafiber, and I have several reasons to say so. I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.",1665.0,aeblpo,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/,477.0,"I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,1628.0,e5rae3,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,353.0,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

I’m an American who was dating a guy from India. We’re both in our late 20s, he’s Catholic, from Kerala, and we had been dating for over a year.

He flew to India to visit his family last September. He said he wanted to go early in the year so that we could spend Christmas and New Years together. But instead he started ghosting me for a couple of weeks and when I wouldn’t stop texting him as I was worried, he finally replied with a long breakup text. He said his parents were retiring and so he was moving back to India forever to help his parents move, and said he had no choice but to break up with me and wants me to move on.

I recently found out from his Whatsapp photo that it wasn’t true at all…in reality he just got married, and he's still working in the states. I have not attempted to contact nor confront him since before he dumped me via text message -- his text was the last piece of communication between us.

I’ve read in passing that it’s not unheard of for NRI's to dump their foreign girlfriends right before they tie the knot with someone in their community, so easily like it’s some sort of past time. And then it becomes this deep dark secret they laugh about with their mates after work. Please tell me this isn't true? When I told our mutual Indian friend about this, he (the friend) was more in disbelief/shock by the fact that it happened to me rather than *what* had happened.

I’m torn between feeling devastated vs. feeling pure anger and hatred like I was just manipulated by a sociopath for over a year.

Why are Parsi Organisations silent on CAA/NRC?,18.0,ei4fmj,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ei4fmj/why_are_parsi_organisations_silent_on_caanrc/,9.0,"&#x200B;

The Parsi community has always been shown as the poster boy by the Indian Government to show how the Indian tradition has been since ancient times to accept people seeking refuge irrespective of their religion.

And it is strange to see that no official Parsi organisation or even any Parsi community or religious leader has come out to criticise the NRC/CAA combination. Consider the fact that communities across different religions have rallied against this discriminatory law. The other day, I read a news article which said that some Church in Kerala opened its doors for Muslims to offer Namaz on Friday at the end of an NRC/CAA protest. There are pictures of Sikhs rallying with pictures of Ambedkar and Gandhi in their hands. These communities have rallied against the law even though it is granting special treatment to them. 

And on the other hand, the Parsis, being a very influential community, in India as well as abroad, has remained silent on this issue. I have googled the term 'Parsi CAA', 'Parsi NRC' and came up with zero relevant results. Checked out Bombay Parsi Punchayet's press releases, they have been silent about this too. Even the top legal minds from the Parsi community like Fali Nariman, Soli Sorabjee and Zia Mody have stayed silent about this. 

I'm sure there must be some Parsis protesting against this on an individual level (especially youngsters), but I think it is important for them to speak out against this at the level of their community forums (which are close-knitted and quite active). I think so because it will mean something when the community which is the country's oldest refugee stands up for the ideals of the country. Well, technically, I don't believe India as a nation existed in 600 AD, but I think it does send out a strong symbolic message. 

I guess I am coming off too strongly against the community, and perhaps this comes from a personal bias against them, so please take this with a grain of salt.

Such a huge victory means what they call 'political capital'. It means that the PM and government enjoys a period where people are not likely to criticise them or turn against them, and they can pretty much do anything. \n\nSo they went ahead and undid Kashmir, then got the Mandir 'sorted' and then moved on to CAA.\n\nWhat was the urgency? \n\nBJP actually believes - this is my impression - that there is a huge Bangladeshi Muslim illegal migrant problem in India. This has been obsessing them for some 2 decades now.\n\nThe party believed that this 'honeymoon period' was the right time to do something about it.\n\nBut there is also a hidden agenda. Which is to scare Muslims. Not to actually throw them all in detention camps, or deport them but to scare them. A way to put them in their place. So, Amit Shah went about tom tomming CAA and NRC and how they would be used to throw out 'termites' and so on. Amit Shah knew that irrespective of the legal standpoint, his Hindu votebank and the Muslims both would translate 'termites' as Muslims. Now, whatever scares Muslims consolidates Hindu votes, in Shahji's calculation.\n\nBy itself this may have been alright. But after the Assam NRC - ridiculous stories coming out of there like https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/former-president-fakhruddin-ali-ahmed-family-again-left-out-of-nrc-list-1594188-2019-09-01 etc, Muslims knew they were under a bigger attack this time. After all, if an ex President's family could not be approved in NRC, what hope does a regular Muslim have? \n\nSo this got Muslims scared properly for the first time. Meanwhile, After Article 307 and Mandir, the anti BJP people of India - remember they are a huge number, may be even 60% or more of the Indian voting population - this got the attention of them too. That for the first time, this was a proper religion filter on a law - and this might be the beginning of a bunch of things. And this agitated a lot of people who would normally sit back and complain but do nothing. This time, it looked like something had to be done to stop this train.\n\nThen followed the Jamia violence, then UP police violence and now JNU and so on.\n\nSo why is the BJP sticking with this?\n\nHere one can only guess. But let me try.\n\n**1) Hard calculations.** While the protests are not ending and are bringing together the anti BJP forces, BJP calculates that their support is also solidifying. \n\n**2) Majoritarian party vs umbrella party / alliance**. An alliance or umbrella party feels a need to get some support from even the opposing side. They have to show that they are listening, taking everyone along and so on. A majoritarian party looks at it as a war. us vs them. So those who oppose are enemies of the party, therefore enemies of the nation, and so no point in talking to them.\n\n**3) Ego.** The protests (not the protests by Muslims) - the metro protests and big city protests with people of all communities - was a shock. This was unexpected. An all Muslim protest was something they would just crack down upon. Like in UP. A Congress-led protest, they can use to paint them as pro Muslim and anti Hindu. Both did not happen. Congress - perhaps wisely or just due to lethargy - has stayed on the sidelines, ensuring that the protests are actually not 'successfully' politicized by BJP. They are trying, though no one believes Cong is behind the protests. So how does a PM and his deputy who had it their way for almost 6 years react to this sudden retaliation? With shock and fury and anger. Stepping back on this would make them look like wimps, they think. This is true. Their supporters would be very disappointed if they do.

Everybody has their own version of truth, which they believe is right (and it often is, just that it is not exhaustive.) They told me how the locals harass the army people, kidnap and even murder them. I listened and told them yes, these things do happen and it's unfortunate that soldiers who are just doing their duty are being abused in this manner.\n\nThen, I told them the story of how I met a Kashmiri student, and how he had told me he saw his own friend get killed in front of his eyes for simply falling in love with an Army man's daughter, and faced no consequences.

In another incident, army men went inside a local boy's home and manhandled the females of the house, which was personally told to me by a friend who had been to Kashmir. I said, if somebody did that to my Mom or sister, I'd obviously hate the army too.\n\nThat's when they realised that any story has multiple perspectives and the situation isn't as black and white as they thought it to be and generalising an entire population without knowing the context serves no purpose.\n\nSo yes, talk to them, put across your point politely and at the same time, try to understand what they believe in and why they do so.

Need clarification about CAA+NRC in Assam. How are they related?,2.0,fuuaqr,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuuaqr/need_clarification_about_caanrc_in_assam_how_are/,4.0,"So NRC is an exercise done nationwide to identify citizens and illegals. It is first being done in Assam as the population there is fed up of Bangali illegals. The NRC ended up recognising 31.1 million people out of 33 million as citizens in Assam. It ended up making 1.9 million people stateless (still being able to appeal), and of those 1.9m, 500 thousands are Hindus.

Then the CAA came, it is supposed to fast track citizenship to immigrants who are of certain religions coming from neighboring Muslim countries.and prevent them from being illegals. This discrimination will apply to most states but the CAA doesn't apply to states like Assam.

So are NRC+CAA even a problem in Assam? And what is the fate of those 500k Hindus in Assam? And finally, why does the act only cover immigrants until 2014? Shouldn't it be an ongoing thing?

My opinion about the whole NRC is that it's an unnecessary exercise creating stress and anxiety to large parts of population in the country which are already poor. The idea of containing Muslim population is not that bad in my opinion, because if they become too many, then problems start. But this whole exercise is  unnecessary and a failure, as both Assam activists are angry and large parts of the population have been made even more miserable.

Found a Q&A which is linked above. Can anyone help me verify these points?",Policy/Economy,False,0.79,"['Disclaimer : I might be biased but I try to be factual.\n\n>**Q.1 Is NRC a part of the CAA?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. No. CAA is a separate law and NRC is a separate process. The CAA has come into force nationwide after its passage from Parliament, while the NRC rules and procedures for the country are yet to be decided. The NRC process that is going on in Assam has been implemented by the Honourable Supreme Court and mandated by the Assam Accord.\n\nThis is true. CAA and NRC are independent but one is followed by the other. As mentioned by Home Minister on many occasions. Paraphrasing him ""Please understand the chronology. First CAA will come followed by NRC. "" So how can you look at them individually?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Q.2 Do Indian Muslims need to worry about CAA+NRC?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. There is no need for an Indian citizen of any religion to worry about CAA or NRC.\n\nThis is a lie. Why? Because\n\n1. Indian citizens need to worry about CAA because the amendment is discriminatory against immigrants based on their country and religion. The bill claims it is protection persecuted minorities but it doesnot use \'persecuted\' in the bill. So it is just bringing in minorities from Islamic nations not from other nations. This carries an inherent message that islam is a bad religion which it is masking under this act.\n2. NRC : This will force every citizen to prove his citizenship.Why should one not be worried by that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Q.3 Will NRC be for people of a particular religion?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. No. NRC has nothing to do with any religion at all. NRC is for every citizen of India. It is a citizen register, in which names of every will be recorded.\n\nHome Minister mentioned in a video that people of hindu, sikh, parsi, christian, buddhist and jain religion need not worry about NRC. So should Jews and Muslims and atheists be worried? How will the names be recorded?\n\nEvery person should and must be worried because now the government will decide if we are citizens of this country according to its wish.\n\n>**Q.4 Will people be excluded in NRC on religious grounds?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. No, NRC is not about any religion at all. Whenever NRC will be implemented, it will neither be applied on the basis of religion nor can it be implemented on the basis of religion. No one can be excluded just on the basis that he/she follows a particular religion.\n\nYes true. No one can be excluded just on basis of religion but they can be excluded just because they don\'t have papers because they are poor or illiterate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Q.5 By conducting NRC, will we be asked to present proofs of us being Indian?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. First of all, it is important to know that at the national level, no announcement has been made to begin NRC process. If it is implemented, it does not mean that anyone will be asked for proof of being Indian. NRC is merely a normal process to register your name in the Citizens’ Register. Just like we present our identity cards or any other document for registering our names in the voter list or getting Aadhaar Card made, similar documents shall need to be provided for NRC, as and when it is carried out.\n\nThis is a lie. If Aadhar or voter card is enough, just use the aadhar data you have and make a register and ask others who don\'t have aadhar or voter id for papers. You will not because they are not the only document required.\n\n>**Q.6 How is citizenship decided? Will it be in the hands of the government?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. Citizenship of any person is decided on the basis of The Citizenship Rules, 2009. These rules are based on the Citizenship Act, 1955. This rule is publicly in front of everyone. These are five ways for any person to become a citizen of India:  \n>  \n>I. **Citizenship by Birth**,  \n>  \n>II. **Citizenship by descent**,  \n>  \n>III. **Citizenship by registration**,  \n>  \n>IV. **Citizenship by naturalization**,  \n>  \n>V. **Citizenship by incorporation**\n\nWho has the discretion now to decide whether the papers submitted are enough to prove citizenship? Isn\'t it the government? Yes they might do it based on the above rules but the CAA 2019 is discriminatory as mentioned above. So one of your rules is discriminatory and hence NRC will be discriminatory.\n\n>**Q.7 Will I have to provide details of the birth of parents etc. to prove my Indian citizenship?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. It would be sufficient for you to provide the details of your birth such as date of birth, month, year and place of birth. If you do not have the details of your birth, then you will have to provide the same details about your parents. But there is absolutely no compulsion to submit any document by/of the parents. Citizenship can be proved by submitting any documents related to date of birth and place of birth. However, a decision is yet to be taken on such acceptable documents. This is likely to include voter cards, passports, Aadhaar, licenses, insurance papers, birth certificates, school leaving certificates, documents relating to land or home or other similar documents issued by  \n>  \n>government officials. The list is likely to include more documents so that no Indian citizen has to suffer unnecessarily.\'\n\nAgain, documents relating to land? How many have that? If only aadhar is enough, you already have the data, why again? It clearly says decision is yet to be taken and also is clear just one document is not enough.\n\nLie. Also, India doesnot give citizenship by birth. You must have both parents to be indian post 2004. So parental documents is a must. So this is a lie.\n\n>**Q.8 Do I have to prove ancestry dating back before 1971?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. No. for pre-1971 genealogy, you do not have to submit any type of identity card or any documents like the birth certificate of parents/ancestors. It was valid only for the Assam NRC, based on the ‘Assam Accord’ and the directive of the Honourable Supreme Court. For the rest of the country, the NRC process is completely different and under The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.\n\nThe previous answer addresses it.\n\n>**Q.9 If it is so easy to prove identity, then how 19 lakh people in Assam were affected due to NRC?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. Infiltration is an old problem in Assam. To curb it, there was a movement and in 1985, the then Rajiv Gandhi government, to identify the intruders, had to enter into an agreement to prepare NRC, assuming the cut-off date of 25 March 1971.\n\nAgreed but how did the relatives of President of India turn out to be infiltrators under NRC?(look it up)\n\nHow can Father be Indian citizen and son be an inflitrator?\n\nAlso, under and government undertaking, there is chance of 5% margin of error. If the governement erroneously declares 5% of its citizens as infiltrators, that is almost 7 crores citizens being declared nationless because of an error.\n\nThe expected infiltrators are less than 1% of population. Just to recognize less than 1% of people, you might falsely declare 5crore people stateless. Exactly like Demonetization.\n\n>**Q.10 During NRC, will we be asked to present old documents, which are difficult to collect?**  \n>  \n>**Ans**. There is nothing like that. Common documents will only be required to prove identity. When the NRC is announced at the national level, then rules and instructions will be made for it in such a way that no one will face any trouble. The government has no intention of harassing its citizens or putting them in trouble.\n\nrepetitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToo long.

But the ToS is where the scheming autocrats sneak their wicked plans, which only the ones who are aware could detect it. The average person,  even if made to be aware, will be reluctant, or at best confused whether to go against their previous judgement.

Although the CAA doesn't actually hide what its for, the subheading is not everpresent in the public view.

When a thing seems good by the look of it, why would an average person probe further.

**NO CAA, NO NRC= bad**  ( prohibiting  citizenship, prohibiting NRC)

**But, the NUANCED TAKE:  
CAA, NRC = could be used to disenfranchise  
NO CAA, NO NRC = right reaction to above.**

So, the actual CAA, NRC would look like     **CAA* , NRC***  
* **conditions apply**

**If the initial reaction is positive about CAA, NRC, why would one get into nuance?**

Heres what needs to be changed
Instead of rejecting CAA, NRC and being on the backfoot, we should promote it. 

**Change the gist of CAA, NRC of being good to being a flawed.**

Advocate:  
1) ""**Non-Discriminatory CAA**"" and you've introduced the idea that the original is discriminatory.

Similarly, NRC is modified, hence advocate for  
2) ""Unmodified NRC"". But that doesn't ring well. So maybe     
""**Untampered NRC**"". It puts doubt that the new one is tampered. 

By advocating these two, maybe, the onus would lie on the authorities to justify their act.

*IDK, Maybe its too late to put this here now, still just putting it up.
Not an expert. Infact I know very little. So Just my views.*

Just wanting to know how optimistic people are about the ongoing protests in India regarding CAA-NRC ?

She has been quite pessimistic since CAA was a bill. She has been saying this government isn't going to do anything about it. On the contrary I have been a bit optmistic regarding all this. Initially I thought that supreme court will intervene (knowing current president is a stamp man, no better than peon putting stamps for the officer). But it has been a month now. CAB become CAA and UP has already started the implementation.

Though there has been a lot of protest and uproar regarding the policies across India, the government conveniently ignored everything and carried on the implementation. 

I have been to both the protests - Jamia and Shaheen bagh, there always have been a huge gathering, esp. Shaheen bagh, which has been on for 24x7 since last one month. I have been challenging her that these people coming up for protest, specially the women, who has been the life of Shaheen bagh protest, has to look after their family as well, aren't doing this for fun. There must be a bit optmistic regarding the situation, giving there all. Although she has been going to protect regularly, she is still quite pessimistic regarding everything.

So I want to know, how many people actually see a hope to all the protests that has been happening across India. Is there a point to it ? Do you think, for once government, which should be for the people, will listen and bring down NRC implementation atleast ?

Is there any other reason/motivation to all the protest if government isn't going to budge regarding the implementation.

Is she being a realist and I'm still being naive believing in false hopes ?

PS: I have been hating the government since the start, not siding knowing all the chutiyapa this government is up to.

How we're losing the war against BJP by continuing to protest against CAA-NRC,5.0,ev6t31,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ev6t31/how_were_losing_the_war_against_bjp_by_continuing/,14.0,"If a totalitarian government wants to take over and carry out their agenda, then a bunch of peaceful college kids with provocative slogans aren’t going to impede it. When even the institutions designed to protect citizens from malevolence, even from a deranged government, is under threat of losing its autonomy, there’s not much we can do. 

The left falsely assumes that wide-spread protests will help curb the problem. They think that if only we become angry enough, and showed less apathy towards the persecuted, and demonize the other side, and deem the neutral observers to be part of the problem, we could unmount the government from its power. I think there’s little reason to believe this will work.

Telling people that they’re wrong and that they’re complicit in a genocide level atrocity while they were essentially uninterested in the issues, is a poor approach to changing minds. Keep in mind that changing people’s minds, and making them understand the scale and urgency of what’s going on, is our objective here. At the end of the day, BJP is running the show because the citizens decided, overwhelmingly, that it was a good idea. The only scenario where we win is if we effectively persuade millions of Indians, many of whom are living in eco-chambers, who’re bombarded with fake news and false narratives about a benign, hardworking, government, and many more who just don’t care because they have other things to worry about.

The protests that revolve around CAA-NRC are unjustified; when you look at the details, you’ll find that their entire positions are founded upon speculations of the government’s intentions, and not based on logical conclusions derived from the details of the bills. And the protests are shadowing the genuine problems with the govt; most recently, they conducted, unambiguously, a state-sponsored terrorist attack in one of India’s finest universities, the JNU. 

It’s important, and crucially so, that we are careful about accusing the government of the right reasons. When you club everything together, it becomes super easy for the other side to point out the hypocrisy, and dishonesty of the left, and use it to hold their voter base from wandering off to the other side. 

BJP probably wants communal disharmony, but it’s not the Hindu-muslim disharmony that’s of interest, it’s the BJP supporters-opposers disharmony. I’ve never seen the nation so polarised before. Conversations have essentially stopped between the two sides because both are convinced that the other one is beyond reason. And when conversation breaks down, the only thing left is violence. We really only have two modes — conversation and violence. So be careful not to escalate the aggression. Go easy on the nazi calling maybe. 

From the right’s perspective, they are seeing two bills which have no real problem with it, which are motivated by compassion towards our fellow non-muslims who’re severely persecuted in the hell hole of Pakistan, and the left is going berserk, and hypocritically they do not give two shits about the lives of these non-muslims. And however they look, they don’t find any evidence for their claims of only Muslims losing citizenship by the millions. The reaction in the entire country is a quintessential example of delusional mobs who don’t have any understanding of what they’re protesting about. Naturally, they distance themselves from the left even more and double down on their support for the nationalistic party with strong leadership. 

This is bad. This will guarantee BJP remaining in power for the next term as well. With the confidence that they won’t be dethroned anytime soon, they can peacefully and diligently work towards making India a Hindu Rashtra. ",Politics,False,0.63,"['[removed]', 'Many like you believe they have finally figured this whole mess out.\n\nYou could be right, or you could be wrong.

That is, all the efforts of 6 years of BJP dogwhistling of ""muslims bad"" have had absolutely no effect on the populace.\n\nBut if that were true, why are there so many anecdotes of dads and uncles saying islamophobic statements?

4- **Misinformation** a real threat, IT cell goons spread blunt and fabricated pieces of information to discredit dissent.

5- **Fake violence** \- oldest trick in the book, staging fake protesters to be violent, to discredit the protesters.

6 - **pro-government rallys** to idk do what, but okay

7- And most important, **detention of leaders**, who are peacefully protesting, and use of the draconian UAPA against leaders to further discredit them.

Deaths do warrant an international response.",AskIndia,False,0.42,"['There is no right or wrong here. It\'s a subjective opinion. People who think in terms of humanity as one will condemn violence everywhere. People who think in terms of nations and artificial concepts like honour will bristle at all criticism, using the phrase internal matter as a mere excuse to hide any injustice.\n\nMost of the world\'s powers have learnt dangers of ignoring issues from history. When they did, they ended up with world wars and ethnic cleaning in europe till the 90s. More recently, Europe and US ignored Afghan and Syria\'s problems and ended up with massive refugee and humanitarian crises. Indian government itself has, correctly, condemned many acts of violence in other countries, which arguably were their internal matters. It\'s also done the opposite, trying to get approval from foreign governments for its own policies - Modi invited MPs from Europe to get their approval of govt actions in Kashmir, arguably an internal matter irrelevant to Europe.\n\nIt\'s especially warranted when there\'s huge asymmetry in power between the two sides as we currently have in India where government, police, army and judiciary have been overwhelmingly hostile towards potential victims of NRC.\n\nI personally don\'t see any problem with it. Injustice is a bigger problem than some nebulous concept of national honour. As a family analogy, think of it this way: if you know an uncle is sexually abusing a child in the family, should you report it to police or atleast confront him and risk neighbourhood gossip and legal consequences?

Silly Question on CAA-NRC and Humanitarian Refuge,10.0,effjvf,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/effjvf/silly_question_on_caanrc_and_humanitarian_refuge/,0.0,"The whole defense behind CAA is that on religious grounds, persecuted minorities will he given haven and a dignified life. Sounds good on paper right? Two points I want to make/questions to ask.


The whole conceptof NRC revolves around taking Indians that have been living here peacefully(and we all know how Muslims are targetted) and putting them in detention centres. If you watch the videos and articles about detention centres in Assam, you will see how there is no humanity or dignity in the way they are made to live.



How can you cry 'humanity and persecution' while persecuting people.

PS: people may argue about living here illegally being a crime, but if you look around and read, there are people without the required documents. Secondly why bring in Aadhar cards claiming they are the final proof of nationality beyond a passport and do this 



In fact, the CAA itself, without NRC contradicts its own claims of humanitarianism. You cannot be partially humanitarian and if an NGO says 'we have resources to help underprivledged children, but only from a certain communities as other communities have their own NGOs', then you can already immagine the outrage. The BJP cannot make claims of being humanitarian while also helping only certain persecuted groups.

Finally, how does someone coming from abroad or someone already in India even prove persecution or the fact that they are not Muslim. Your Aadhar and Passport dont mention either. The fact that we are buying unimplementable pipe dreams and the ones selling them keep on and on with contradicting statements needs to be resolved",Politics,False,0.81,[],False,False,False,False,False,True

But after that one time event , I do not see any more avenue on where to participate and contribute to that movement.  I am sure there are more NRI in this sub-reddit who are in similar boat.  Any guidance will be appreciated. 

FYI, I am very private person on the internet. I do have facebook and twitter account but do not post or comment at all. Once in a while I login to see how are my friends and family members are doing in life, and  I do see hate filled  posts  by many of old colleagues and friends . I have not engaged with any of them as it's very clear that they are not going to change their mind irrespective of logic or fallacy of their arguments.  I just unfriended my old friend in facebook because I can't see his hate filled posts after calling himself secular, and they have already proclaimed that whoever disagrees with him/her point of view is uneducated, traitor and shall go to Pakistan.  Given that I have been silent on facebook for years,  any advice on shall I become active and any advice on that too. 

I have pulled myself out of whatsapp because most folks are for CAA and NRC or in other words they are full supporter of Modi-Shah. But they try not to discuss politics, but there are folks who keep on forwarding hate filled messages , twisting every facts and figure with self selection biases.  I have had reacted strongly to one forward which said that anyone who does not support and forward a message is traitor. They person apologized by saying do not take forward seriously. I had quit that group after that. 

However, when I do go to parties, I clearly engage in conversations where I and may be other are on one side of conversation and everyone is on other side.  It does create awkward situation in relationships and wife constantly tells me why you have to care and engage so deeply in conversations. Same is situation in my extended family where some folks hates Muslim and it would come out after few minutes of conversation, and others are under the influence of modi propaganda but with with argumentation, facts and logic they can see that their beliefs are potentially wrong. 

&#x200B;

Only good news in all the situations is that all the kids of the NRIs who goes to American schools  know that their islamophobic parents are on wrong side of history. During debate, they would support me by questioning their parents and their logic is so sound and they are so patient and unemotional that parents are speechless. But the kids know their boundaries and they move on with their life. So I am so optimistic that next generate of Indian origin kids will be more rationale , inclusive and will make this world a better place. So hope is very much alive.

>**Q.1 Is NRC a part of the CAA?**  
>  
>**Ans**. No. CAA is a separate law and NRC is a separate process. The CAA has come into force nationwide after its passage from Parliament, while the NRC rules and procedures for the country are yet to be decided. The NRC process that is going on in Assam has been implemented by the Honourable Supreme Court and mandated by the Assam Accord.

This is true. CAA and NRC are independent but one is followed by the other. As mentioned by Home Minister on many occasions. Paraphrasing him ""Please understand the chronology. First CAA will come followed by NRC. "" So how can you look at them individually?

&#x200B;

>**Q.2 Do Indian Muslims need to worry about CAA+NRC?**  
>  
>**Ans**. There is no need for an Indian citizen of any religion to worry about CAA or NRC.

This is a lie. Why? Because

1. Indian citizens need to worry about CAA because the amendment is discriminatory against immigrants based on their country and religion. The bill claims it is protection persecuted minorities but it doesnot use 'persecuted' in the bill. So it is just bringing in minorities from Islamic nations not from other nations. This carries an inherent message that islam is a bad religion which it is masking under this act.
2. NRC : This will force every citizen to prove his citizenship.Why should one not be worried by that?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>**Q.3 Will NRC be for people of a particular religion?**  
>  
>**Ans**. No. NRC has nothing to do with any religion at all. NRC is for every citizen of India. It is a citizen register, in which names of every will be recorded.

Home Minister mentioned in a video that people of hindu, sikh, parsi, christian, buddhist and jain religion need not worry about NRC. So should Jews and Muslims and atheists be worried? How will the names be recorded?

Every person should and must be worried because now the government will decide if we are citizens of this country according to its wish.

>**Q.4 Will people be excluded in NRC on religious grounds?**  
>  
>**Ans**. No, NRC is not about any religion at all. Whenever NRC will be implemented, it will neither be applied on the basis of religion nor can it be implemented on the basis of religion. No one can be excluded just on the basis that he/she follows a particular religion.

Yes true. No one can be excluded just on basis of religion but they can be excluded just because they don't have papers because they are poor or illiterate.

&#x200B;

>**Q.5 By conducting NRC, will we be asked to present proofs of us being Indian?**  
>  
>**Ans**. First of all, it is important to know that at the national level, no announcement has been made to begin NRC process. If it is implemented, it does not mean that anyone will be asked for proof of being Indian. NRC is merely a normal process to register your name in the Citizens’ Register. Just like we present our identity cards or any other document for registering our names in the voter list or getting Aadhaar Card made, similar documents shall need to be provided for NRC, as and when it is carried out.

This is a lie. If Aadhar or voter card is enough, just use the aadhar data you have and make a register and ask others who don't have aadhar or voter id for papers. You will not because they are not the only document required.

>**Q.6 How is citizenship decided? Will it be in the hands of the government?**  
>  
>**Ans**. Citizenship of any person is decided on the basis of The Citizenship Rules, 2009. These rules are based on the Citizenship Act, 1955. This rule is publicly in front of everyone. These are five ways for any person to become a citizen of India:  
>  
>I. **Citizenship by Birth**,  
>  
>II. **Citizenship by descent**,  
>  
>III. **Citizenship by registration**,  
>  
>IV. **Citizenship by naturalization**,  
>  
>V. **Citizenship by incorporation**

Who has the discretion now to decide whether the papers submitted are enough to prove citizenship? Isn't it the government? Yes they might do it based on the above rules but the CAA 2019 is discriminatory as mentioned above. So one of your rules is discriminatory and hence NRC will be discriminatory.

>**Q.7 Will I have to provide details of the birth of parents etc. to prove my Indian citizenship?**  
>  
>**Ans**. It would be sufficient for you to provide the details of your birth such as date of birth, month, year and place of birth. If you do not have the details of your birth, then you will have to provide the same details about your parents. But there is absolutely no compulsion to submit any document by/of the parents. Citizenship can be proved by submitting any documents related to date of birth and place of birth. However, a decision is yet to be taken on such acceptable documents. This is likely to include voter cards, passports, Aadhaar, licenses, insurance papers, birth certificates, school leaving certificates, documents relating to land or home or other similar documents issued by  
>  
>government officials. The list is likely to include more documents so that no Indian citizen has to suffer unnecessarily.'

Again, documents relating to land? How many have that? If only aadhar is enough, you already have the data, why again? It clearly says decision is yet to be taken and also is clear just one document is not enough.

Lie. Also, India doesnot give citizenship by birth. You must have both parents to be indian post 2004. So parental documents is a must. So this is a lie.

>**Q.8 Do I have to prove ancestry dating back before 1971?**  
>  
>**Ans**. No. for pre-1971 genealogy, you do not have to submit any type of identity card or any documents like the birth certificate of parents/ancestors. It was valid only for the Assam NRC, based on the ‘Assam Accord’ and the directive of the Honourable Supreme Court. For the rest of the country, the NRC process is completely different and under The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.

The previous answer addresses it.

>**Q.9 If it is so easy to prove identity, then how 19 lakh people in Assam were affected due to NRC?**  
>  
>**Ans**. Infiltration is an old problem in Assam. To curb it, there was a movement and in 1985, the then Rajiv Gandhi government, to identify the intruders, had to enter into an agreement to prepare NRC, assuming the cut-off date of 25 March 1971.

Agreed but how did the relatives of President of India turn out to be infiltrators under NRC?(look it up)

How can Father be Indian citizen and son be an inflitrator?

Also, under and government undertaking, there is chance of 5% margin of error. If the governement erroneously declares 5% of its citizens as infiltrators, that is almost 7 crores citizens being declared nationless because of an error.

The expected infiltrators are less than 1% of population. Just to recognize less than 1% of people, you might falsely declare 5crore people stateless. Exactly like Demonetization.

>**Q.10 During NRC, will we be asked to present old documents, which are difficult to collect?**  
>  
>**Ans**. There is nothing like that. Common documents will only be required to prove identity. When the NRC is announced at the national level, then rules and instructions will be made for it in such a way that no one will face any trouble. The government has no intention of harassing its citizens or putting them in trouble.

repetitive.

>**Q.11 What if a person is illiterate and does not have relevant documents?**  
>  
>**Ans**. In this case, the authorities will allow that person to bring a witness. Also, other evidence and community verification etc. will also be allowed. A proper procedure will be followed. No Indian Citizen will be put in undue trouble.

Witness? Witness for what? Who can be a witness?

>**Q.12 There are a large number of people in India who do not have homes, are poor and are not educated and they do not even have any basis of identity. What will happen to such people?**  
>  
>**Ans**. This is not entirely correct. Such people were on some basis and they also go the benefit of the welfare schemes of the government. Their identity will be established on the basis of that.

But usage of welfare schemes is not proof of citizenship for the government. Even aadhar or passport are not proof of citizenship. Blatant lie.

>**Q.13 Does NRC exclude anyone for being transgender, atheist, Adivasis, Dalits, women and landless without/ without documents?**  
>  
>**Ans**. No NRC, as and when carried out does not affect any of the mentioned above.

Does not affect? So aren't they gonna need to submit documents? They do, that means, each and everyone is going to be affected.

"The A,B,C on CAA & NRC",11.0,eqw3kv,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eqw3kv/the_abc_on_caa_nrc/,8.0,"It’s outrageous that people can even support this open discrimination against Muslims.

Millions of people in India and around the world are not just protesting against the CAA and NRC but also against the failed BJP government. Is middle India only bothered about investing in Kashmir, building a Ram temple, and taking in Hindu refugees? None of these items put food on the table for normal people. These do nothing to secure a border to prevent people from crossing over, nor is there any policy of things that matter to all Indians, like increasing the availability of college education, healthcare, and building more infrastructure. These are common sense topics that are overridden by religious tension, which is played up by BJP as a distracting veil over all the issues.

Here’s the A,B,C on CAA and NRC -

A.	⁠ CAA/NRC doesn't mean anything for the non-Muslims in Pakistan who are being prosecuted today. It only applies to those who are already in India prior to 2014. 

B.	⁠⁠The protests are not against providing refuge to non-Hindus. They are against the implications of: ⁠
1.	⁠Only providing refuge to non-Muslims who are already in India prior to 2014. If the government really cared about religious persecution, they would've worded it accordingly instead of explicitly naming 6 religions except Muslims. ⁠
2.	⁠Coupling CAA with NRC and creating a loophole to provide everyone but Muslims refuge in the country. So many Muslims who were born and raised in India, but whose parents either came in illegally or whose parents don't have the necessary documentation from 40+ years ago, would be deemed illegal immigrants and kicked out or thrown into detention camps. 
3.	⁠⁠These protesters disagree with the draconian mistreatment of minorities in Islamic countries like Pakistan. And that's exactly why they don't want to see their India turn into something similar where Muslims are seen as villains simply because of their religion. 
4.	⁠Rampant corruption. A fucking sarkari babu holds power on making you an illegal. India is one of the most corrupt countries in the world and it’s giving power to these illiterate sarkari babus on who gets to be indian. This is the biggest joke. These idiots can’t even build a straight road without asking for kickbacks, and now you expect ordinary Indians to trust them. BJP has done jack shit to fix this deep rooted corruption.

C.       As an illustration of the evil link between NRC and CAA, if you are a bengali Muslim who ran away from East Pakistan during the 1971 war (wars cause refugees to run across borders because of rape and pillage and the other horrors of war) you will have descendants in India who have lived all their life here post 1971. Maybe there's documentation of this refugee status, but there probably isnt, but even if there is, you could have lost it in the floods (quite common in that part of the country). Your kid now can't prove citizenship by NRC standards even if they have tax receipts and have lived here all their life. You are now an illegal who can never apply for citizenship, you will be detained or deported. If you were a Hindu that did the same, you can now apply through the CAA. How is that okay?

D.      CAA and NRC makes it twice as hard for muslims to prove citizenship and apply for it. this is unfair in of itself! Why is it okay to say that we will make it much harder for you precisely because of your religion?

E.       Why aren't we letting in Sri Lankan Hindus: 

1. The selection of these countries in of itself stems from what seems to be a clear bias. Pretending as if only Islamic states are capable of persecution despite literally all evidence pointing otherwise (Myanmar and Sri Lanka have had long standing conflicts driven by state persecution, as examples), and that's why other communities from other countries aren't included. 

2.  Even if we bought for a second that it is about issues in these countries, there is widespread persecution against Muslims in these countries too, so why are we solving the issues selectively?

F.      Even if we take a strong stand against illegal immigration: hate to say this, but in this case why are the other illegal immigrants okay to naturalize? If this were your actual position, much as I disagree with it, the ideal way would be to draw up a quota and do it randomly rather than discriminate against one particular community.

G.       Where the hell are you going to house all these illegal immigrants, that have now been suddenly naturalized with the snap of a finger?What jobs are they gonna get, what education are they going to receive? Assam is in arms and protesting the destruction of their culture with the huge influx of bangla Hindus. But the government doesn’t give a fuck and actually is breaking multiple constitutional laws impacting Assam specifically on the protections they receive.

H.      NRC treats 'non Indian' Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, differently to non Indian muslims and that's not fine. Unless you mean to say that even if you are a non Indian hindu you are truly Indian, whereas if you're a non Indian Muslim then you arent Indian because of partition. Partition shouldn't be a reason to avoid help suffering people, plus the people living now had no say or control over the partition anyway.

I.     It seeks to legally establish Muslims as second-class citizens of India by providing preferential treatment to other groups. This violates the Constitution’s Article 14, the fundamental right to equality to all persons.

Since there are protests being held everywhere, I'd request the people participating in it online or otherwise to always couple CAA+NRC together in any content/post/placards you make.

Most of the mainstream media is covering the protest as if they're only against CAA & that gives them a chance justify/counter it by saying it doesn't affect Indian citizens, so why are you bothered?

We need to make sure that the outgoing message is against NRC & CAA equally. Also that CAA+NRC is not only a threat for Muslims, but also people of any other religion who aren't able to provide the documents.

Eg: A ""Hindu refugee"" from Bangladesh will be given citizenship under CAA, but a Hindu born & brought up in India has a very good chance of being declared an ""illegal immigrant"" just because he might not have the documents dating back to the cut-off year & because he is not an immigrant from the 3 countries.

Also, some might say that the rules for nationwide NRC are not out Yet, the NRC in Assam was so strict because they have an infiltration problem from a porus boundary with Bangladesh, but the whole country doesn't.

The counter for the above can be that yes, the rules for a nationwide NRC aren't out yet but:

1) let's say that the nationwide NRC doesn't need such strict proof, so what is the point of such NRC as an ""illegal immigrant"" could have forged recent documents, hence rendering NRC useless.

2) If it is the same as Assam, then there will be a lot of genuine Indians who might end up being stateless & immigrants becoming citizens.



I'm sharing a simplified explanation, in case you need to explain to someone.


Edit 2: in the below info graphic, the fig 1 says that your passport is not a valid proof of citizenship, which is kinda wrong as a passport issued prior to 1971 is admissible in the NRC. I should've said ""your current passport on its own is not a valid proof of your citizenship""

Theoretically all the non-muslims can still become citizens of they claim and prove that they are illegal migrants from the CAA related countries. But there seems to be some serious practical and procedural problems for this so called safety net offered by the CAA to non-muslims. Some of these are listed below. I hope everyone would engage with these questions and give their suggestions on how these situations will be dealt with by the state. Also feel free to post your own doubts and problems in the comments which haven't been listed here.

1. According to the Assam model, there will be multiple arbitrations and updations after the first NRC and during these procedures the involved parties in all probability would make claims that they are Indian citizens and might even give affidavits confirming these claims starting from local bureaucrats to the foreigners tribunal. Once these statements are in their files how can they claim that they are undocumented migrants from foreign countries who could avail the protection offered by the CAA, if they are absent from the final NRC?
2. How can people prove that they are from the specific countries. It should be kept in mind that most of the m couldn't produce any documents prove their Indian citizenship. How would they then establish foreign citizenship and religious affiliation convincingly?
3. What would be done if people convert or blindly claim that they belong to one of the persecuted minorities ?
4. What would happen with children of undocumented migrants (born in India) belonging to minorities from the three countries? They were never foreign citizens and never faced persecution for their religious beliefs.
5. What would be the status of atheists and children from inter-religious marriages?

Unless the government can give convincing answers to these questions and to the numerous others raised by various critics and sceptics moving forward with the implementation of CAA-NRC would be disastrous and would render very large sections of the society stateless. It might also lead to a mafia supplying fake documents and would encourage rampant corruption among the various levels of the bureaucracy. The Muslims who can't prove their citizenship convincingly will be surely screwed. Also beyond this a large number of poor Hindus and other religious minorities and dalits will also be rendered stateless by the NRC and they might not be protected by the CAA (which I believe was a main agenda for the government).

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans.

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries.

>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

Vangaurd of proleteriate is the ""elite"" who are part of the government who can lead us to communism. Then I started researching about free market capitalism. I didn't read all of wealth of nation by adam smith but this video summarised it well according to me ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejJRhn53X2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejJRhn53X2M)). After reading up on capitalism, I find all the reasons for lot of economic problems in India is the lack of free market. The Tatas , Ambanis etc are just crony capitalist not free-market capitalist. We are essentially living in a feudal country where a few people and the government decide how we live and this is being fueled by socialism i.e our government. 

**Mindset:**  

Right now the only way we think about changing India is voting someone into the government and then praying that they are good. That is literally the only thing we can do. If someone day-dreams about changing the country they day dream about become a politician and an elected member. This thinking is fundamentally different from the thinking if we were raised in a free market capitalist system.

There are no tools available if one individual wants to make a change. I was reading up on the US and i found a fact that only 16% of the millionaires have inherited wealth. So that means tools are available in free-market economies to actually pull yourself up.

**Some problems due to socialist system**

I think the reason we have so much competition to get into good colleges in India is because we have so few good colleges which have funds and the reason for that is socialism. Indias entire education budget is about 1 billion([https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/budget-2020-major-hits-and-misses-of-education-budget-for-higher-education-1646023-2020-02-13](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/budget-2020-major-hits-and-misses-of-education-budget-for-higher-education-1646023-2020-02-13)) while the budget of Yale ALONE is 30 billion dollars.

We cannot change that. We just pray that the government does something good. There are no tools available for us as individuals to work and actually produce output and put into causes we believe in because the government decides everything for us and we trust them. Giving exam and joining government is not an alternative.

I also think the reason for farmer suicide is the government because of artificially setting prices and protectionism. (I need to do more research on this)

We literally have no means to protect our self if the government decides to do anything against us. We are sitting ducks just praying government does something for us.

The reason for corruption/ being late etc being in our blood is because of the socialist mindset we have grown up in. It is not just with people in India its common in people from all countries with socialism.

**Two drawback I see for free-market capitalism are**

1) Monopolies 

2) Producing goods which don't have profit.

My thoughts on problem 1)

We already have monopolies with the chrony capitalist and government itself is a monopoly so this problem is not limited to free-market capitalist economies. If we move to free market capitalist economy we need to setup ""competition"" laws which break up big companies.

My thoughts on problem 2)

Things like building roads, lamps etc probably should be handled by government.

I would like to really hear thoughts about being socialist or free-market capitalist from this sub. I am trying to make sense of economics.

**TL;DR:**

Governments job should only be to protect private property and maintain fair competition.",Policy/Economy,False,0.57,"['I need to do research on this. \n\n\nBro, you need to do a lot more research on everything.', 'Free market Capitalism has made masks vanish from markets leaving medical professionals with nothing in US, also the pricing of kit is making it more difficult to detect', 'First of all, I agree with you that India needs Free Market Capitalism. But that doesn\'t mean we don\'t need Socialism. These two can very well coexist.\n\nAnd second of all, just because our preamble says we are socialist, it doesn\'t necessarily means that we are full blown socialist. We have the lowest Investment to GDP ratio in education and healthcare which are the two pillars of socialism. And the gap between rich and poor is increasing every year. And the percentage of national wealth owned by the Top 1% is increasing every year.\n\nFinally, even if we include ""Free Market Capitalism"" in our preamble, our policy making might not reflect that. We would still continue to help private banks from bankruptcy at the cost of exchequer. \n\nSo we need much more than simple change to our preamble. We need actual policies that are free market. And we need to increase our Education and Healthcare budget by several fold. And I strongly disagree that we need to leave education to free market. That would put enormous pressure on our future.']",False,False,False,False,False,True
"There is a ""hopelessness"" situation here where everyone think you can't win against BJP in 2024. This is not true.

Don't lose hope like that.  We can easily pull them down in next election.

The truth is that most parties within NDA hate Modi government because due to their sheer majority, BJP alone is eating the biggest share of the corruption loot. These parties will jump towards any direction which will offer them something more. Just like Maharashtra or Karnataka has shown.

If we had worked a bit harder and got just 40 seats more, we wouldn't have Article 370 removal, CAA, NRC and other disastrous situations.

Found something that you should know about Rohingyas.,47.0,ewtwas,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ewtwas/found_something_that_you_should_know_about/,13.0,"This post is not specific to India but the topic is being used as an argument point all over the country right now. 

Background - Recently I got into a friendly argument with a fellow redditor over CAA/NRC who told me why Muslim minorities like rohingyas should not reside in the country. I had heard the term before but didn't knew anything about them. So I took a day, did a bit of research and this is what I found out.

(Side note - I would recommend you to Google rohingyas and read about them yourself even if you know about them. You might learn something new.)


1. THE ROHINGYA PEOPLE are an ethnic group from Myanmar, once called Burma. Most live in Rakhine State on Myanmar’s western coast.

Myanmar is a majority-Buddhist state, but the Rohingya people are primarily Muslim, though a small number are Hindu. The ethnic minority is considered “the most persecuted minority in the world” by the United Nations.
Source- https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/people/reference/rohingya-people/

2. The Rohingya population is denied citizenship under the 1982 Myanmar nationality law. They are also restricted from freedom of movement, state education and civil service jobs.
The official stance of the Government of Myanmar is that the Rohingya peoples are citizens of Bangladesh, as a result of the British partitioning of their Asian possessions.
Source - https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/burma/burm005-02.htm#P132_34464

3.The Rohingya conflict is an ongoing conflict in the northern part of Myanmar's Rakhine State (formerly known as Arakan), characterised by sectarian violence between the Rohingya Muslim and Rakhine Buddhist communities, a military crackdown on Rohingya civilians by Myanmar's security forces, and militant attacks by Rohingya insurgents in Buthidaung, Maungdaw, and Rathedaung Townships, which border Bangladesh.

An August 2018 study by Harvard University estimated that in the same period, 24,000 Rohingyas had been killed, 18,000 Rohingya women and girls had been raped, 116,000 Rohingyas had been beaten, and 36,000 Rohingyas had been victims of arson.

Entire Muslim Rohingya villages in Myanmar have been demolished and replaced by police barracks, government buildings and refugee relocation camps, the BBC has found.

4. Read this slowly and carefully again. 
Using statistical extrapolations based on surveys conducted with a total of 3,321 Rohingya refugee households in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, a study estimated in January 2018 that during the genocide, the military and the local Rakhine Buddhists killed at least 24,000 Rohingya people, gang rapes and other forms of sexual violence against 18,000 Rohingya Muslim women and girls, 116,000 Rohingya were beaten, and 36,000 Rohingya were thrown into fire.

What Andhbhakti and Godi Media can do to someone,198.0,f5wdyq,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f5wdyq/what_andhbhakti_and_godi_media_can_do_to_someone/,103.0,"So, a bit of context here. I'm 16, and My parents are regular BJP supporters and a regular watcher of Sudhir choudrey. I don't mind that. They voted for BJP in 2019 elections. Don't mind that either. Support CAA and basically everything BJP does. That kinda was a shock for me, so in December I sat down with them and had a casual chat, not trying to appear too political in front of them, as they don't like it.

Both my mom and dad said ""Beta hum to Andhbhakth Nahi Hain, but modiji Jo Kar rahe Hain desh ki bhalai ke liye hai, congress mein bahut scams hua tha to BJP chun liya""

Hmm. Typical Bhakt mentality. Didn't really mind that too, didn't expect much anyway.

From January onwards, I started doing some intense research and factchecking on everything that happened in politics since 2004. My views completely changed. I went from being apolitical to being genuinely worried about the future of our country.

In mid January, the Indian residents in Colombo (where I live) were having a CAA-NRC protest in the Indian Embassy. Two of my friends were going. But as soon as my parents figured out, they went crazyyy. I got grounded for a week, electronics confiscated, and was called an ""antinational, deshdrohi, anti-modi pappu supporter (tho I don't support congress )"" and so much more I can't even put in words possibly.

I let that happen. More things happened, i just let it happen. This was becoming commonplace now. Until today

I was just sitting on my desk, studying for mock exams, when my dad calls me. He asks me why dosent UAE, Saudi and other gulf countries take in rohingyas if they're so important to me apparently. He was arguing why rich middle Eastern countries, thousands of kilometres away from the refugees, take in those people if they really are so important. After completely countering his dumb logic, he snapped.

(Btw, my dad had always supported equality. Never seen him like this)

He got up and started shouting in my face about how Muslims are a plague and they were taking over the damn world. He said that Muslims don't migrate to Muslim countries, instead to other non Muslim countries coz there they will have 5-6 children and spread their relegion. Then, they take over the entire govt once their population gets high enough and collapse entire governments. He then started saying about exactly the things godi media says, about how Hindus are in EXTREME DANGER to Muslims and how India will turn into a fascist Muslim state if nothing is done, even if all stats point otherwise. As soon as I pointed it out, ironically I was hit with ""YE SAB FAKE NEWS HAI YOU ARE USING WAYY TOO MUCH INTERNET FOR A CHILD"". Ironically, I'd heard Sudhir choudrey say something similar to this, about how children spend too much time researching fake news on politics and the internet, not 3 weeks ago. After his Muslim rant was over, he shifted to Hindus.
 As ""proof"", he said all Muslims read Qur'an and pray in mosque, which according to him, even tho we are from uttar pradesh of all states, less than 1% of Hindus read holy books and go to temple and properly follow our relegion. He continued about Hindu supremacy, about how we should be superior. I'd never heard him talk that way. To try and calm things down, I tried to remind him I'm athiest. That was the end to it.

I got dragged by the ears, and got smashed on the head with a steel plate that was nearby. Got slapped and hit, didn't do anything. He said that he's going to disown me if I don't say I'm a pure Hindu in 5 seconds, which I out of no choice did, and that I will read 30 pages from Ramayana and bhagvad Gita everyday. He called me a terrorist, a failure, a shame on India and consequently locked me in the room and confiscated everything I had. Typing all this from grandmother's phone.

All the emotional weight aside, I feel like I've lost it. I've lost the freedom to speak. The freedom of speech. The right to have an opinion.

Everything I say, I get back a ""tum bachche ho, 18 Saal ke hokar Kuch Karna, tumhe Kuch samajh Nahi aata""

So much more things happened that I can't describe. I was hit so bad, and insulted to the face because I had a different opinion. I thought about it and realised all my dad did for past 3 years was watch zee news continuously from 7 pm to 10 pm. Nothing else. Having an opinion is deshdrohi, antinational, and if you don't support our great leader mudi, you shall be banished in hell. I'm emotionally drained. 

Tl;Dr: had a different opinion than Bhakt parents. Got beaten up and scolded and locked up for that. 

I don't know where else to post this, I feel like I cannot trust anybody anymore, that I've been stripped of basic rights.

The only way tackle the current regime is to educate the younger generation. Here's how,620.0,en1mr4,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/en1mr4/the_only_way_tackle_the_current_regime_is_to/,114.0,"I have a sister who's in 6th grade. My parents are extremely pro BJP, and I've tried changing their minds, but they're bigots, so I gave up. But my sister was curious as to what's happening around in the country because I've been extremely anti-BJP, and she knows I went to a lot of protests. 

So I tell her about CAA, NRC and all the hindutva bullshit BJP leaders have been spewing since they got a brain cell.
Told her facts about the current state of economy, unemployment, women safety etc. Our parents always keep telling us that it's important to focus on studies and leave the politics for the old. But she understood that if we don't fight for ourselves no one will. Also told her how important it is to elect the right people and how powerful we as citizens still are, by giving her the example of Kejriwal and all the good shit he's done in Delhi. 

And imo this is the only way we can deal with the current regime. The most we can probably do now, is teach the younger generation how important it is to raise your voice and ask questions. So that the by the time they grow up to be eligible to vote, they have an idea of the political climate in the country. I urge yall to do the same. Go speak to youngsters who are unaware of the situation. Everyone is curious, but the government has just made the atmosphere so bad that they're scared to ask questions.

Edit: A lot of y'all say, I might have imposed my political ideology on my sister. I didn't go to her telling this is what the Modi government is doing, she instead asked me what the reasons for the protests were.

Get ready for a huge surge of Muslimophobia and Hindu nationalism after/during this lockdown,21.0,fvdta1,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvdta1/get_ready_for_a_huge_surge_of_muslimophobia_and/,7.0,"I'll be straighforward: our country already has a lot of Muslimophobia (I am not gonna say Islamophobia because hating Islam as in ideology shouldn't be treated as a bad thing. Treating Muslims badly because you hate Islam, on the other hand, should be bad) and Hindu nationalism is evidently on the rise. Even though at first thought, it might seem that coronavirus may not affect the rate at which these two are growing, it is going to affect it in a huge way. 

The biggest blunder has to be the Tablighi Jamat. Out of 3000+ cases, 1000+ cases (more than 33% of the cases) has been linked to the Jamat. Among the rest, if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona, you will see a lot of them (if not most) had visited Saudi Arabia or other Muslim countries. As you might know, Muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events. There is a huge chance that the entire coronavirus epidemic in India maybe said to be 'brought by Muslims to harm Hindus'. The number of fake news which tries to show that Muslims are deliberately trying to harm Hindus is already bad.

Unfortunately for Muslims, during this crisis when they were already being alienated by CAA-NRC, Jamat has been responsible for the steep rise in cases. Not that Hindus or other religions did not do something like that - Hindus got together in Vaishno Devi, they got together in many festivals, they got together during gaumutra party, they got together for 'thali bajaa'ing. But there has been no cases linked to any of those events. It might be that there are coronavirus carriers and cases among them, but since it isn't testable and observable, we cannot make any definite statement, it won't be scientific.

To make things worse, if we somehow get through this nightmarish pandemic, remember Modi will get all the credit. People will say that ""Modi handled the pandemic in India well"". This might even increase his approval rate among common people. Not to mention that if the apparent growth rate of cases in India remains slower than other countries, as it currently is, it might increase people's faith in the  superiority of India. People might say ""Look at those immoral westerners. They have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma. That is why India, such a holy land, hasn't been greatly affected by it apart from those Muslims and Chinese who brought that disease to India!"". This narrative might gain a lot of attention.

Apart from the lack of entertainment, 'chaddi humour' (See the 'stars of bollywood' sing songs about chaddi), Injustice to several deserving candidates (Teri Mitti snubbed), but most importantly, the most horrible about the show, as it is still being telecasted right now, is the silent political agenda that is being carried in the show. 
 Note that many notable stars who are regular part of the show each year are missing. Some of the names being Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Salman Khan, The Bachchan's and even the top winner of the night Gully Boy director Zoya Akhtar was absent for the program. Any links among the names? SRK, Salman and Bachchan's never seem to answer anything political. Deepika, we all know what happened a month ago. Zoya Akhtar has been actively protesting CAA-NRC. 
 I don't know if this is true or not (please verify if you can) but I read somewhere that BJP paid nearly 28 crores to TIMES Media to make the event happen in Guwahati, Assam where the political atmosphere has been quite tense in the past times. If you're watching the programme, then you might have noticed how everyone who comes up on the stage has been praising Assam and how wonderful everything is there. Once or twice was okay, but say that a lot of times, you know something's wrong. Also, URI not winning any major award might well be to hide the fact that the awards are not biased towards movies portraying Nationalism. The National Film Awards have been criticised for that.

There are a bunch of protests being called in different venues across the country.  These are being called in support of Jamia and AMU, in support of the ongoing protests in the North-East, against the CAA, etc. 

Here's an incomplete list. Different organisations have called different meetings, and it's not clear who's supporting who. I would suggest you find out a little bit about it online but do go and support the protests if you're near these venues or care enough to go.

**Things to keep in mind when going for any of these protests**

* Go with a buddy. Keep track of each other
* Bring a bag with water and snacks, these things can go long
* Bring pollution masks and scarves to protect against the cold and the smoke
* Wear sensible shoes
* Bring your placards! Get creative, it's a great way of expression
* *Don't* engage in violence. The police are great at instigating violence, as are elements of opposing ideologies who intermingle with protests. There's also the human element of getting carried away by the crowds. Resist those urges
* Do your best to follow the directions of the leaders of the protest - these things are most successful when they're done in sync and will ensure that some control is there.
* Keep an eye out for your fellow humans - if someone looks to be in trouble, help them out as best you can. 
* *Don't panic.*
* Keep emergency contact numbers on hand. 


**Suggestions while recording evidence and documenting the protests**

It's important to film and record as much as possible. Obivously in crunch time it's tough to keep a clear head, but here's guidelines to help. 

* Try to keep as steady as possible - find a safe spot to record from. 
* If you're recording while moving, try to capture as much background evidence as possible in order to help people identify the location and context of the protest. 
* Narrate the events that are happening and clearly spell out the time and date. T

**What to do if police action happens**

If things descend into chaos, which is unlikely but clearly possible, it's important to keep calm.

* Get to safety. Identify the nearest safe spot and head in that direction, ideally with your buddy/buddies.
* Defend yourself, but don't retaliate. The burden of proof is higher for citizens unfortunately, so be careful.
* Do *not* try to kick back or pick up the tear gas canisters. They're incredibly hot and can explode. 
* Cover your eyes nose and mouth. 
* If you get water cannoned, try to hide behind things like bus stands, trees, etc. Bring a towel and spare sweatshirt just in case. 
* Record whatever you can.
* Don't panic or get scared or feel cowed. That's what they want to happen.
* [This thread](https://twitter.com/TheSphinxSpeaks/status/1207434348502212608) is useful for responding to Section 144


And above all, don't give in to cynicism.

Edit: **Dec 19 UPDATE:  My earlier post (i.e. [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eci6xa/update_regarding_the_19th_december_anticaa/) ) seems to have been removed, so I'm copy+pasting all of what I wrote there here, as it is relevant for protesters today. Adding it below. Mods, please let me know If I'm breaking any rules and how I can correct them.:**


# Are the protests still happening? #

As of now, most of the protests that are called will still go forward. The people organising the protests in most other cities have had far too much experience with situations where police permissions have not been granted. There is *always* strength in numbers. The best response would be to check with people updating online via Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

Some people in bangalore have floated the idea of just getting together in groups of 3 with black clothes and placards in distributed public spaces, taking a photo and uploading it online. There are other such ideas floating, but you should keep track individually online. 


I urge you to to check twitter, instagram, and Facebook to find out updates for your specific city. Some potential sources from Twitter include [NRC Protests](https://twitter.com/NrcProtest) and [Yogendra Yadav](https://twitter.com/_YogendraYadav), beyond the obvious news websites. Instagram - @standtogetherunited, @shirtshanks. There are others, can include if you have suggestions.

# iF there are no police permissions should I still come? #

As I said earlier - the organisers of most protests have committed to going forward with some form of action. It would be a slap in the face of our notional Democracy to do otherwise. And as I said earlier as well: most organisers have been in this situation before, and know how to handle it. I can personally vouch for the Delhi protests as having teams of doctors and lawyers on hand independent of the police to keep things peaceful. Similar arrangements have been made in other cities, though I haven't kept track of how developed they are. 


There has never been a mass protest in the history of activism that hasn't broken some law in the process of effecting change.  The entire Indian National Movement was founded on the notion of civil disobedience and non-cooperation; If you go back and read the British newspaper clippings and articles of pre-Independence you will see a picture painted of the protesters back then that are similar to the picture painted of protesters today: ""stay in your lane"" or ""why cause a ruckus."" The fear of state repression did not stop people during the Nirbhaya protests and it hasn't stopped the North-East right now. 

If you're scared, we all are scared. That fear is natural, and understandable. I personally believe a future *without* resistance is much scarier. To put it another way: I've always regretted the protests I *didn't* go to, rather than the protests I did. My conscience won't let me roll over, my optimism won't let me be cynical and feel like none of this matters, and my study of the social sciences tells me that there is hope in the long run. 



Having said that, it is obviously a very daunting perspective to do something as scary as open defiance and public activism, and it is an individual's choice. Look up the situation in your own cities, talk to your friends, talk to your neighbours, talk to your students' groups, and take a personal call.

If you still want to take part, please join online in whatever way you can - counter IT trolls, expose bots, question official handles on the repression of public expressions of dissent, etc. Protect your privacy and identity while you do that, of course. But don't remain silent.



# What are my rights during the protests? #

@standtogetherunited on Instagram put up a list of your rights and how to respond to detention/arrest etc. My understanding is that these were written by a mix of lawyers and experienced activists who have used these. The key is to be cooperative to police directives, but also firm and knowledgeable. It's important to note that different circumstances like Section 144 and all will affect things. Know the law/ask lawyers who will be at the protests to inform/guide you.

Re: Protesting and Debating with a Bhakt,37.0,ee2kha,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee2kha/re_protesting_and_debating_with_a_bhakt/,11.0,"So trying this in hope of learning and teaching:

1) stick to arguments that you actually won't get wrong footed on. If you make a valid argument but are unable to answer some vague or stupid question, you will be labeled all sorts of things. 

If however, you stick to claims and arguments that you can't be caught out on, then even if they don't listen, they cant get overly defensive. 

For me: those arguments are about The cost and stress. That DeMo was hard for you and people in villaiges didnt even know their notes were invalid. With CAA/NRC it will be worse. Link in the economy. Talk about the 1600Crores required to implement NRC nationwide while there is no money for revamping education in JK, the same region Modi promised to safeguard.


2) Bombard them with verifiable facts. Granted, they may employ mental gymnastics or straight up refute and get defensive. The point is, dont let them plead ignorance like they don't know. Don't let them stay ""apolitical"" when infact they are just manaaoing Bhakti.

3) To people bringing up protestors that weren't sure what the protest was about. Also send them videos of people backing CAA without any clue what they were on about. But more importantly make a compelling argument along the lines of ""People not fully understanding the issue does not, in anyway take away from the argument being made by people that raise their voices in protest."" Maybe even drop in a snide ""just like you thinking its good doesn't take away from my protesting""

4) The violence of protests. Don't try and defend attacks on property. Chances are they wont buy into the ""Police is in Modi's pocket and our targetting muslims"". Tell them that you condemn all violence as that is not what you stand for. But try to point out, through some tweets that I will link below that clearly show that the police isn't some perfect institution either. Show them how any notion that police are saints is false 

5) If they make a point about it only being about muslims being brainwashed and divided into thinking they are targetting. Point out that its a terrible precedent they are setting when they try and put down a minority's protest like that. Tell them a minority doesn't need Hindu support to be valid. Also bring in photos and posters of people of all walks of life(NOT JUST RELIGIONS). Show them students, older people, hindus muslims, foreigners. Show them that it's a nationwide protest and dont let them hide away from images of the sheer numbers. Also bring up the track record of leaders like Adyinath and Saakshi Maharaj

6) as for the argument of majoritarianism, that ""They won seats, they represent us"", point out that it is no excuse. Firstly tell them that BJP won only 37% of LS votes so the notion of them representing the majority of the nation is a lie. Secondly tell them about how it is not an excuse, that even though Trump won, he is still being impeached for being a bad leader. Just because someone is in power, doesnt make them right.


7) Arguments about 'you are protesting and raising slogans. Therefore democracy'.   Let them know this: protests aren't being made thanks to democracy, they are being made despite it being suppressed. Talk about how pro CAA protests are allowed, talk about the usage of tear gas inside hospitals which go against UN sanctions.

Khattar is atleast paying lip service to Delhi's complaints, but in terms of practical impact that's as good as doing nothing.\n\nThe only thing that's going on is a paddy vs crackers blame game between Hindus and Sikhs in the Punjabi public discourse."", ""Because crop burning has objectively gotten worse in the last few years. It's got nothing to do with Sheila Dikshit or Arvind Kejriwal. It's got to do with Punjab's groundwater crisis. I'll try to explain in this thread.\n\nIf you ask Punjab's farmers, they'll tell you that paddy sowing season used to begin in the first week of June. By mid-October, the paddy would be harvested and by November, the next crop, wheat, would be sown.\n\nIn the time between paddy harvest and wheat sowing, farmers would decompose the stubble over a month. It was water-intensive and time consuming, but it didn't pollute the air.\n\nBut the paddy crop started taking a toll on Punjab's groundwater levels. The land of five rivers was running out of water and paddy sowing coincided with the worst of the Punjab summer.\n\nOf course Punjab Government also wanted water available to homes in the summer, not all of it could be routed to the fields. So the paddy sowing season was delayed to late-June. That ended up pushing the entire crop cycle by a month or so.\n\nThis meant that the window between paddy harvest and wheat sowing, which used to be over a month, reduced to just a few weeks. That is why the last week of October and first week of November gets so bad in Delhi.\n\nSo now, farmers have neither time nor resources to decompose the harvest. Simply giving them money for equipment is not enough. Everyone is in a terrible spot. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there is not much anyone can do about the smog. \n\nhttps://www.news18.com/news/immersive/crop-burning-punjab-pollution.html\n\nhttps://www.news18.com/amp/videos/india/reporters-project-why-punjab-framers-are-still-burning-crop-stubble-1929133.html?__twitter_impression=true"", ""It is supposed to be called North India's pollution problem.

MegaThread: Press conference of four senior Supreme Court Judges.,495.0,7pv5r2,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7pv5r2/megathread_press_conference_of_four_senior/,193.0,"An unprecedented event occurred today in the history of India. Four senior SC judges came out against the institution in a PC. Out of all links [this](http://www.news18.com/news/india/supreme-court-live-cji-to-meet-attorney-general-as-rebellion-by-four-sitting-judges-rocks-top-judiciary-1630073.html) seems to be more comprehensive. Let's have a mega discussion on this.

EDIT: Below is the full text of the letter ....


It is with great anguish and concern that we have thought it proper to address this letter to you so as to highlight certain judicial orders passed by this court which has adversely affected the overall functioning of the justice delivery system and the independence of the high courts besides impacting the administrative functioning of the office of the Honourable the Chief Justice of India.

From the date of establishment of the three chartered High Courts of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, certain traditions and conventions in the judicial administration have been well established. The traditions were embraced by this court which came into existence almost a century after the above mentioned chartered High Courts. These traditions have their roots in the angle saxon jurisprudence and practice.

One of the well settled princples is that the Chief Justice is the master of the roster with a privilidege to detemine the roster, neccessity in multi numbered for an orderly transaction of business and approriate arragements with resepct to matters with which member/bench of this court (as the case may be) is required to deal with which case or class of recongnising the privilidege of the chief justice to form the roster and assign cases to difference members/benches of teh court is a convention devised for a disciplined and efficient transaction of business of the court but not a recongnition of nay superior auhority, legal or factual of the chief justice over his colleagues. It is too well settled in the jurisprudence of this country that the chief justice is only the first amongst the equals — nothing more or nothing less. In the matter of the determination of the roster there are well-settled and time honoured conventions guiding the chief justice, be the convention dealing with the strength of the bench which is required to deal with a
particular case or the composition thereof.

A necessary corollary to the above-mentioned principle is the members of any multi-numbered judicial body including this Court would not arrogate to themselves the authority to deal with and pronounce upon matters which ought to be heard by appropriate benches, both composition wise and strength wise with due regard to the roster fixed.

Any departure from the above two rules would not only lead to unpleasant and undesirable consequences of creating doubt in the body politic about the integrity of the institution. Not to talk about the chaos that would result from such departure.

We are sorry to say that off late the twin rules mentioned above have not been strictly adhered to. There have been instances where case having far-reaching consequences for the Nation and the institution had been assigned by the Chief Justices of this Court selectively to the benches “of their preference” without any rationale basis for such assignment. This must be guarded against at all costs. We are not mentioning details only to avoid embarrassing the institution but note that such departures have already damaged the image this institution to some extent.

In the above context, we deem it proper to address you presently with regard to the Order dated October 27, 2017 in R.P. Luthra vs Union of India to the effect that there should be no further delay in finalizing the Memorandum of Procedure in the larger public interest. When the Memorandum of Procedure was the subject matter of a decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association and Anr. vs Union of India [(2016) 5 SCC 1] it is difficult to understand as to how any other Bench could have dealt with the matter.

The above apart, subsequent to the decision of the Constitution Bench, detailed discussions were held by the Collegium of five judges (including yourself) and the Memorandum of Procedure was finalized and sent by the then Hon’ble the Chief justice of India to the government of India in March 2017. The Government of India has not responded to the communication and in view of this silence, it must be taken that the Memorandum of Procedure as finalized by the Collegium has been accepted by the Government of India on the basis of the order of this Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record-Association (Supra). There was, therefore, no occasion for the Bench to make any observation with regard to the finalization of the Memorandum of Procedure or that that issue cannot linger on for an indefinite period.

On 4th July, 2017, a Bench of seven Judges of this Court decided InRe, Hon’ble Shre Justice C.S. Karnan (2017) 1SCC 1]. In that decision (refer to in R.P.Luthra), two of us observed that there is a need to revisit the process of appointment of judges and to set up a mechanism for corrective measures other than impeachment. No observation was made by any of the seven learned judges with regard to the Memorandum of Procedure.

Any issue with regard to the Memorandum of Procedure should be discussed in the Chief Justices’ Conference and by the Full Court. Such a matter of grave importance, if a all required t be taken on the judicial side, should be dealt with by none other than a Constitution Bench.

The above development must be viewed with serious concern. The Hon’ble Chief Justice of India is duty bound to rectify the situation and take appropriate remedial measures after a full discussion with the other members of the Collegium and at a later state, if required, with other Hon’ble Judges of this Court.

Once the issue arising from the order dated 27th October, 2017 in R.P.Luthra vs. Union of India, mentioned above, is adequately addressed by you and if it becomes so necessary, we will apprise you specifically of the other judicial orders passed by this Court which would require to be similarly dealt with.

Would request you all to forward this to your friends, family and all groups",1.0,fgszlb,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fgszlb/made_a_whatsapp_forward_explaining_the/,0.0,"We see a lot of forwards going around in Whatsapp and Facebook. Lets also share the truth about the coronavirus disease and how we can stop the spread.


—————————————


*What is coronavirus?* It is a family of viruses that cause common cold like symptoms and respiratory problems. It’s basically the common cold. But this time, we are dealing with a new member of this virus family, which has been named COVID-19.


—————————————


*What happens if I get infected?* Many people get infected with mild symptoms and recover on their own. Most common symptoms are fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, sometimes diarrhea and fatigue. A few number of people develop respiratory problems like pneumonia and need to be hospitalized. Also some people who have a weak immune system need to be hospitalized.


—————————————


*What is happening in China and Italy?* This disease is highly transmissible, which means it is very easy to spread this disease to others. The number of people that need to be hospitalized are a low percentage, and most of them are people over 40-50 years of age. In China and Italy, thousands of people got infected, which was more than the hospitals could handle. Remember, we have a limited number of hospitals, doctors, nurses, and a limited number of hospital beds. Over flowing the hospitals resulted in the situation that we see in China and Italy.


—————————————


*How do I know if I am infected?* Most people don’t show symptoms immediately, but scientists believe people start showing symptoms after 5-14 days. What this means is that YOU can spread this disease without even knowing that you are infected. This is exactly what happened and led to the situation we see in China and Italy.


—————————————


*What do we do to be safe?* Maintain good hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water frequently, and after using toilets, or when you are outside. Using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is also effective, but soap and water is the best method. Be sure to rub your hands for at least 15 seconds, this is what removes the virus from your hands. Always cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, with a cloth or tissue, and be sure to wash your hands again. When outside, avoid touching things for no reason, and avoid touching your face, mouth or nose. Maintain at least 3 feet distance to anyone in public and move away if someone is coughing/sneezing. Always clean/disinfect surfaces at home/work. Remember, you might be healthy, but you can still spread the virus to someone who might need to be hospitalized. The only way to not over flow the hospitals is to make sure that we keep ourselves and everyone around us safe.


———————————————


*Does this virus cause deaths?* Majority people recover completely with minor symptoms. Most deaths are caused in elderly people with pre-existing health conditions and people with a weak immune system. To help hospitals treat them better, we need to make sure that resources are available for them which means we need to protect ourselves and everyone around us. If you are feeling sick, don’t go to work else you will just be spreading the virus to everyone.


———————————————


*Do I need to wear masks?* Masks are only useful for people who are infected, so that they do not infect others. The surgical masks that doctors wear are so that droplets from your cough/sneeze do not float around and infect others. The other type of mask N95, can filter out 95% of all airborne particles. But to use this correctly, proper training is required. Buying up and hoarding N95 masks is not required. This prevents availability of these masks for doctors and nurses that really need them. Remember, only use masks if you are sick, else basic hygiene habits will keep you safe.


Please share with all your friends and family.

The cloth over his head seemed to signal the eternal blackness that was about to follow after a few seconds.\n\nIt\'s strange how time seems to elongate during the last moments of your life.

So many people have died..."" asked Yakub.\n\nTiger pulled the toothpick out of his mouth. A fleck of meat from last night\'s dinner was stuck to it. ""See this? If this tiny bit of flesh had stayed stuck in my teeth, it would have caused a decay. The infection would prevent me from eating. When I remove this, I feel relief. The pleasure of picking your teeth is unparalleled, don\'t you think?""\n\nYakub sighed. Tiger had clearly gone rabid. It\'s strange what systematic brainwashing could lead to.

My question is: what could have the Government of India done better in handling this? Assuming the scrapping of the Article is inevitable (by this government), should they have given a prior notice? If it's good and if people like, appreciate and welcome it, why not come out in the open before the act? Some like this and some don't. Wouldn't this cause public outcry and probably protests and clashes? However, on the other hand, aren't disagreements and disputes expected and part and parcel of democracy? Why shut down the place altogether? Who's to say this won't happen to other states? Some say it's entirely legal while others say it's not and that it would be challenged in the Supreme Court.

"DAY 6 - Right to Privacy Hearing in Supreme Court , a Gist - Taken from FB",7.0,6r3rsj,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6r3rsj/day_6_right_to_privacy_hearing_in_supreme_court_a/,2.0,"Supreme Court nine judge bench hearing Right to Privacy (Day 6)

Today was the last day of hearings by the bench and both halves had been allotted equally. As it turned out, the government took much longer to complete it's arguments leaving the petitioners lesser time in the end.

The hardline taken by the Union of India all these days continued. ASG Dwivedi wanted privacy to be located in one constitutional Article - not all over the place, reiterating that privacy as a mercurial abstract concept which cannot be located in Part III (which deals with all FR’s) as had been suggested earlier by the CJI.

Curiously, Justice Chandrachud said that India is an economic powerhouse because of 1.3 billion people and their knowledge economy and privacy must not stifle that economy.
Curious because it seemed like the same line taken by pro Aadhaar business houses. 

However, that was about the only time today that the anti Aadhaar camp had some jitters.
The government pointed out that Privacy ought to be “reasonable” and if there is no injury (damage) caused then there is no question of privacy. His anti Privacy rant continued and annoyed the bench quite often. Justice Nariman firmly told him that that just because currently privacy is nonexistent, it is no ground to say it should not exist.

The government said that large aspects of privacy are already covered in existing ordinary laws and we don't need a separate (fundamental) right to provide protection. US does not use a fundamental right to privacy they said, rather liberty was protected.

**PETITIONERS REJOINDER**

Gopal Subramanium (GS) expressed disappointment at the State's stand and said that there is no need to look at all the American judgments to determine if there should be a right to privacy. 

The words in OUR Constitution are not narrow and should be understood/interpreted in their fullness. Even if privacy is a borrowed notion, that has no relevance - because so is liberty, sovereignty etc.

GS traced the evolution of human rights. Referring to IBM, census, Holocaust in Nazi Germany, WW II then talked about suspension of fundamental rights during the Emergency. GS distinguished today from emergency. Whereas in emergency there was a proclamation, here we have no such declaration yet the govt wants liberty to be suspended.

Adv Grover, Kapil Sibal, Shyam Diwan, PV Sundaresan, Arvind Datar all spoke for a brief while each reiterating the need for a FR to Privacy. Perhaps, the petitioners case was best summed by Meenakshi Arora who said:
> “The state cannot say I will give you welfare benefits if you give me your privacy.”
> Hearings are complete and judgement is reserved.

How long?

There is no fixed limit – it is up to the judges.

###Context

SAFF stands for South Asian Football Federation. It is a regional tournament which kicked-off yesterday and Bangladesh are the hosts. The finals are on 15th September. The 7 participating teams are Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The 7 teams are divided into two groups. And top two teams from each group play the semi-finals.

**Group A:** Pakistan, Nepal, Banglaesh, Bhutan

**Group B:** India, Maldives, Sri Lanka


India has won the SAFF a record 7 times but this time we have sent the U-23 team so it won't be a walk in the park like old times. We have also invited Nepali, Bangladeshi and Pakistani redditors to participate in the thread so it should be fun. Also, subscribe to r/IndianFootball

Which is basically strengthening the economy.

Example, let's say there is some country which has a total of 1000 1 unit currency note, if someone destroys 1 note, other 999 notes will now have a value of 1.001, right?


So, applying that logic to India, which I read online (not sure how correct the source is) had about $1.9 trillion dollars worth of unaccounted money, let's say out of this 15-20% of the money was in the form of these 500-1000 currency notes, if they are all destroyed, wouldn't this lead to appreciation of Rupee,which I assume by some significant amount?

Edit: Some discussion took place here,  https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5c8ojn/final_modi_currency_removal_megathread/d9uhfdo
",AskIndia,False,0.85,"['Short answer: Yes\n\nLong answer: The strength of a currency is the amount of goods and services it can buy, and when there is excess of currency in the economy (M1 i.e. cash and cash equivalents) which can be directly be exchanged for stuff, there is inflation. Inflation reduces the value of money because you need to have more money to buy the same amount of product. When the amount of money is reduces, inflation falls and hence the currency does not weaken at the same rate. But other currencies are weakening or remaining the because of inflation or lack of it. Hence you will feel like the currency is getting stronger.\n\nNow some numbers.\n\nLests assume you could have bought 1 kg of potatoes at Rs 10 three weeks back. Now within a week there is a corrupt cop who takes Rs 2 from everyone in the vegetable seller. \n\nSo the next week the potato seller will increase his prices to Rs 10.5 per kg to compensate for the loss in revenue. \n\nNext week the policeman feels like having potatoes and goes to the market to buy the potatoes. The potato seller seeing the increased demand increases the price for potatoes to rs 11/kg\n\nNext week, Mr. Karvind Ajriwal becomes the PM and instructs the CBI to arrest the corrupt policeman. Now the potato seller does not have to pay rs 2 to the policeman, so he can reduce the price of potatoes. Also, the demand has dropped as the corrupt policeman is in no state to buy potatoes. So the price of potatoes is back to rs 10/kg.\n\nNow lets see the value of Rs.\n\nWeek1: Rs1 would buy 100g of potato\nWeek2: Rs1 would buy 95g of potato\nWeek3: Rs1 would buy 91g of potato\nWeek4: Rs1 would buy 100g of potato\n\nSo as you can see, the value of Rs1 has suddenly increased as it can now be used to buy more.', ""Demonetization is deflationary. It results is reduction in money supply thereby putting the downward pressure on inflation. \n\nInflation differential between two countries is the main cause of the change in exchange rate of their currencies. So if US inflation it 1% and India 5%, we can expect a 4% depreciation in rupee. Just an example. If Indian inflation goes down we can expect the Rupee to strengthen. \n\nHowever the RBI and the country can't let the Rupee appreciate too much as it will impact our exports. Today morning itself, Chinese weakened their currency and in such a world we can't let INR appreciate.  \n\nSo the RBI will keep buying dollars to keep the Rupee from appreciating. "", 'Another way to look at it, \n\nReports say 3 lakh crore could be lost/destroyed. That is $45 billion.\nThe government will know how much money they had circulated earlier, and after the exchange they will know how much was destroyed. So now the government can just reprint that destroyed money and keep it. Effectively they have confiscated that $45billion people destroyed.\n\nIn my opinion, to the government this is a great source of income because they effectively confiscated 100% of the money that was destroyed instead of 40% tax people would have paid on it']",False,True,False,False,False,True
What Modi's Black Money Surgical Strike missed out!,9.0,5ceh1o,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ceh1o/what_modis_black_money_surgical_strike_missed_out/,20.0,"What Modi's Black Money Surgical Strike missed out

While I welcome Modi's announcement of new measures to curb Black Money(of which you can read my view [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5btv1v/eli5_what_the_abolition_of_500_and_1000_rupee/d9rc0yq/)), I only wish the entire process could have been done in a sophisticated well-thought out manner so that he could have earned the praise from everyone and prevented slander from other parties if not outright rejection from quite a sizeable number that it was all a jumla yet again because of such revelations [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5c8ojn/final_modi_currency_removal_megathread/d9uljz7/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5c98x9/modis_hypocrisy_brought_to_you_by_press_trust_of/)!

So here I've compiled a list of what was missed out and how it could have been rectified.

The biggest problem is inconvenience that has been faced by the common folk of India going about their daily lives. Why has the government failed to anticipate this? Why didn't they care for the common folk? Has anyone seen anyone other than a average Joe stand in a queue for withdrawing money? Why is it always the common man who should be put into hardship?

This could have been rectified quite easily. For example, A normal circular been sent to all banks announcing that we are bringing Rs.2000 notes and silently get the new Rs.500 notes in a special ATM box in each bank branch. Then Modi could have announced about the 500 and 1000 notes being invalid. The option of exchanging older notes using the special ATM's as mentioned above could have been done so that normal folk's lives would not have been impacted. Some might ask, what if people who have hoard of cash just exchange it this way and avoid being caught? It could have been easily circumvented by two things:

1. Each customer who comes in for exchanging notes be asked to enter his bank account if exchanging more than a minimum amount, say 10k.
2. Each customer who comes in for exchanging be photographed or be iris scanned and stored in a DB so people trying to bypass the system by exchanging smaller amounts multiple times without entering the bank account will be caught.



Secondly, Participatory Notes: Why are participatory notes still not curbed? Everyone knows these are the main runners in the Sensex in terms of anonymity and these are the easiest way for the terrorists and anti-social elements to wash their black money in the market. Yet, even as we speak of banned 500 & 1000 and introduction of 2000, 500 & 1000, we are yet to hear of 
banning of these participatory notes which would have showed some resolve on the government to really curb BM.


Thirdly, declaration of foreign assets of Indians filing their Income Tax. Only those with huge financial wealth can go ahead and purchase assets in foreign countries. And out of those, a majority have shady black money which makes it easier for them to just take it away from India and convert it into assets there. So why are they not being targeted? Why is the government not making it mandatory for such people to declare their holdings and assets abroad while they file their IT in India? So how is the government going to curb black money if these very same people bring in the washed money from overseas as FD for new businesses?

Translation : 

&#x200B;

The streets were completely deserted.

Was unaware of my innocence.

The calamity that came

From the huts to the havelis were disturbed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All were imprisoned in their nests,

The flight of the bird was free.

Everyone cares about their loved ones,

Here my mother was upset with my hunger

Was a father,

Part of which was more sin than virtue.

Drunk of the morning item,

Pete was at night in the myth of Pete manhood.

&#x200B;

More than death, she was afraid of her God,

Perhaps that's why she used to stay at work all day.

Now sobs were also slow due to beating of weeks,

My mother was in a prison with a sinner. 

&#x200B;

Ration at home was also less,

More than an empty stomach, conditions were lost.

Don't know who was guilty of this plight,

To my ignorance, the government was the soldier of the street.  


&#x200B;

Days were passing like months,

Was waiting for help, sorry for the poor.

Now guess what, what to tell, was government business,

The months have gone by.  


Then some angels came every day,

Seemed to have come in search of a poor.

Four cameras were also brought with half a kilo of potatoes,

Did not know that they had come to give something, or had come to buy self-respect.  


It was heard again and again that the poor thing is poor,

Not everyone will be able to give it to those who are close.

Someone's eye on me too,

Leave it to the voice, it is a favor, it is a strange addiction. 

Knowing in a prickly heart that I am poor,

&#x200B;

Then there was also a feeling of how close to reality I am

A question also arose in the mind,

palace had come to my hut to erase the lust of their virtue,

Then how am I poor?

I wrote a series of three poems in which I tried to incorporate all of my understanding of life in terms of math, physics and philosophy. At this current time, I believe we must all make an effort to understand both the sides. I would like to share with you guys the first one and hopefully if you guys like it I'll be glad to share the remaining two. I want to clear up that I respect both these forces and look down on neither of them. However there are bad apples on either side who we should be vary of and that is my effort with these poems, to show the potential mistakes of each and to show the power of each as well. 

I am the Big Bang!

Where from came this world,
What caused the big bang?
At the astronomical scale, 
It seemingly springs from One,
At quantum scales however,
This vision gets undone,
What was one Universe there,
Here seems like so many,
So many questions I had,
I did suffer their tyranny,
The path reason/science had laid,
I followed into class,
Answers I got seemingly,
Till my view became crass,

Dissatisfied I was,
To religion I went,
I got answers complex,
My mind was then bent,
Stories they had many,
And these I was sold,
To blindly believe, 
And to pray I was told,

Unsatisfied I still was, 
The questions still remained,
For deep down within me,
Is where the quest was ingrained.
To myself I did then look,
To find the real answer,
I then closed the book,
And my two eyes shortly after,
Then it was that I did see,
What I had been missing,
Deep within me was another eye/I
Always in reach for a kissing.
My body I was definitely not,
Science had this taught me,
All the atoms making me,
had slowly been replaced,
The ones I had at birth,
Could no longer be traced.
My emotions I was not,
Most of them were lame,
Religion had this taught me,
Their trauma I could tame,
The I was the constant truth,
Throughout the entire story,
The distractions all around,
Had made me miss it's glory.
In the backseat was it sitting,
Quietly all journey long,
Bring I forward I do now,
To drive this chariot strong.

The remaining two parts are named ""The Challenge for Science"" and ""The Problem of Blind Religion"".

I live in NCT so I understood the seriousness of the issue and decided to interview some of these farmers to know and understand their side of the story as well.

Facial Recognition in India: Part I,195.0,f547t3,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f547t3/facial_recognition_in_india_part_i/,23.0,"## 

https://preview.redd.it/2za3mmqqbfh41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7ad4f61cbaf55a003992857455d489617a663a

## Tl;dr

IFF has been tracking various facial recognition technology (FRT) projects in different stages of development all over India. In the first part of this three part series on FRT, we have mapped major FRT projects in different states and broadly classified them into two categories according to intended purpose: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.

## The Government needs to calm down!

In 2015, [**Jacky Alcine**](https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/615329515909156865) was surprised to find an auto-generated album in his Google Photos folder which contained a photo of his African-American friends categorized as “Gorillas.” This categorization had been done by the facial recognition software that Google Photos used to automatically sort any photos uploaded by the user. After Jacky posted this image on Twitter, the resultant outrage was immediate and understandable and Google promptly removed the offending categorization.

In order to understand why this error occurred and why many civil liberties organizations are calling for a ban or a moratorium on FRT, we need to understand how machine learning occurs and how bias in the samples used will lead to bias in the recognition done by the software. However, even before understanding these important questions and trying to come up with workable solutions and standards, the Central Government and different State Governments have already started deploying FRT for two major purposes: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.

## Facial Recognition for Security/Surveillance

One of the biggest causes of alarm currently is the [**Request For Proposals (RFP)**](http://ncrb.gov.in/TENDERS/AFRS/RFP_NAFRS.pdf) issued by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) which would be used to create a national database of photographs which would help in swiftly identifying criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like Passport, CCTNS , ICJS and Prisons, WCD Ministry's KhoyaPaya, NAFIS or any other image database available with police/other entity.

While this national level project is still in nascent stages, police departments of various states are already in possession of FRT developed by public and/or private developers such as:

1. [**TSCOP + CCTNS in Telangana**](https://www.medianama.com/2019/10/223-hyd-police-on-collecting-biometrics-of-suspects/)
2. [**Punjab Artificial Intelligence System (PAIS) in Punjab**](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/facial-recognition-ai-is-shaking-up-criminals-in-punjab-but-should-you-worry-too_in_5c107639e4b0a9576b52833b)
3. [**Trinetra in Uttar Pradesh**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/up-police-launch-trinetra-its-ai-powered-face-recognition-app-to-catch-criminals/1426618/)
4. [**Police Artificial Intelligence System in Uttarakhand**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-police-acquire-face-recognition-software-to-help-nab-criminals/story-hIO0dmwRfOcK9npC0IMjtM.html)
5. [**AFRS in Delhi**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-police-is-now-using-facial-recognition-software-to-screen-habitual-protestors)
6. [**Automated Multimodal Biometric Identification System (AMBIS) in Maharashtra**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/biometric-identification-system-iris-fingerprint-scans-to-fight-crime-5864905/)
7. [**FaceTagr in Tamil Nadu**](https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-acquire-face-detecting-app/article23410231.ece)

We have already sent a notice to the Delhi Police over their illegal use of FRT during the recent protests in Delhi ([**Read about it here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)). In Telangana as well, there have been multiple instances where police officers have been illegally asking individuals to submit their biometrics.

Simultaneously, the Ministry of Railways has announced its own facial recognition based security/surveillance system called [**Internet Protocol (IP) based Video Surveillance System (VSS)**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=197330) to be provided by RailTel under the Nirbhaya Fund. The South Western Railway started implementing the first phase of this project, and it has stated [**in a press release**](https://swr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd=3370&id=0,4,268) that it has been successful in developing a suitable facial recognition system which has 100% success rate in acquisition and matching of faces.

## Facial Recognition for Authentication of Identity

[**In a press release**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=183958), the Ministry of Civil Aviation announced the Digi Yatra Programme which primarily aims to increase the ease and efficiency with which passengers at airports are processed from the moment they step into the airport till they board their flight by making the whole process paperless and using the biometrics (face) of the passenger as their boarding pass. The Government has already started rolling out Digi Yatra on a trial basis in different airports like [**Hyderabad**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/hyderabad-airport-launches-face-recognition-system-for-entry-on-pilot-basis-1562059587608.html) (July 2018), [**Delhi**](https://www.medianama.com/2019/12/223-face-recognition-digiyatra/) (September 2018) and [**Bengaluru**](https://scroll.in/article/929851/facial-recognition-as-airports-in-india-start-using-the-technology-how-will-it-be-regulated) (December 2018).

Recently, the [**Telangana State Election Commission**](https://tsec.gov.in/pdf/ULBS_MPLTS/circulars/2020/Cir_No_111_TSEC-ULBs_2020_dated_18.01.2020_1401.pdf) also came up with a similar idea to counter impersonation in polls. TSEC with the help of the Telangana State Technology Services tested FRT in 10 polling stations in Kompally Municipality of Medchal Malkajgiri district by using the technology to verify the identity of voters by comparing the photographs taken at the polling station with photographs of the voters in the TSEC database.

FRTs are increasingly being used by educational institutions to verify the presence of teachers and students. The [**Gujarat Government**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-gujarat-new-system-of-teachers-attendance-through-face-recognition-5975585/) has introduced a FRT system with a geo-tagging feature which ensures that primary school teachers themselves are present in schools and they are not being replaced by unauthorized and unqualified “proxy” teachers. Elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, the Government Higher Secondary School in Triplicane has installed a camera which is equipped with FRT in order to mark attendance of students. Similarly, IIT Delhi also has a FRT enabled attendance app in place which is called Timble.

The most recent use of FRT for authentication of identity that we came across is proposed use of the technology by the Maharashtra Government in order to record who avails its Shiv Bhojan Scheme. Shiv Bhojan is a scheme aimed for impoverished sections of society, wherein in select locations around Mumbai, the Government will serve thalis of food at a nominal rate of Rs.10.

## Fighting Back against FRT

FRT projects are becoming dangerously popular in India with various national level projects (AFRS, DigiYatra and IP VSS) underway. However, all these projects have been implemented without any legislative framework governing their operation. Be that as it may, the most worrisome part is not just the implementation of a faulty FRT system but also the implementation of an accurate system which could become a tool of mass surveillance. These problems will be discussed in the next part of this series.

To counter this grave threat to the privacy of all Indians, IFF has taken various steps. We have sent legal notices to NCRB and Delhi Police against use of FRT without any statutory basis or procedural safeguards. We have also filed Right to Information requests in conjunction to every such instance of FRT that we have come across. We will keep you updated as and when we receive responses to our RTI requests.

How to get birth certificate in Tamil Nadu: A guide [OC],22.0,egruug,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/egruug/how_to_get_birth_certificate_in_tamil_nadu_a/,0.0,"This guide is only for the State of Tamil Nadu. I know nothing about other states. Can't help you with that and I hope someone else does it for your state.

Irrespective of your position on the CAA/NRC, prudence dictates that necessary steps be taken in preparation to ensure a hassle free process. So, this is a guide (restricted to birth certificate - will do others if its requested) to either get an updated birth certificate or to apply for a new one. Tamil Nadu has one of the best birth and death registration rates and hopefully, anyone born after 1990 can immediately get their birth certificate from their corporation website (unless you were ""naturally delivered"" in a sintex tank and have been living under a rock). For this guide, I'll illustratively take the district of Chennai and demonstrate:

Go to the corporation of Chennai website - you will find a tab for ""Birth/Death Certificates"" - click on that which will take you to an option called ""verification/printing of birth certificate"" - it will take you to the search page wherein you will find two options - basic search and advanced search. 

If you are born after 1990, you can adopt the advanced search route  by filling in your name - date of birth - leave the place of birth as not known - do not enter the name of your father or mother (leave it blank - If you fill it up, for some fucked up reason the site will return a error message most of the time) - fill in the verification number and click submit. Your electronic birth certificate, digitally signed by the City Health Officer will be generated as a pdf file. Thats it - you have got your verified and updated birth certificate. This is a free service provided by the TN Government and don't shell money by doing this same process through a broker. Thats it - you have got your verified and updated birth certificate.

If your or someone else's birth was not registered at all, you can apply for it with your corporation for a new issuance. Upto one year from the date of birth, there is free registration. Beyond one year, an application fee of Rs 10/- has to be paid. 

If the birth is within 6 years from the date of application, the following documents are required: (a) Parent's identification & address proof - family card/voter id/aadhar card/driving license. (b) Filled in application. 

If the birth is prior to 6 years from the date of application, the following documents are required:(a) Bona fide certificate from the school which mentions the child's name, date of birth and father's name; (b) Parent's identification & address proof - family card/voter id/aadhar card/driving license/PAN Card/Passport; (c) Filled in application. 

If the birth is prior to 15 years from the date of application, the following documents are required:(a) SSLC certificate; (b) parent's identification & address proof - family card/voter id/aadhar card/driving license/PAN Card/Passport; (c) Filled in application; (d) An affidavit on a Rs20/- stamp paper by the parents sworn before a notary public on the date of birth of the child. The affidavit must also be affixed with the photographs of the parents and the child. 

Also have the following documents ready, if you have them: (a) Ante-natal care card of the mother; (b) Post Natal Care Card of the Child; (c) The certificate provided by the Hospital on birth; (d) If its a home delivery: A letter attesting birth at home by two members of the public who are familiar with your family; (e) If you dont have anything, there may be an inspection report from the health department who will attest to your birth at your home by making field inquiries (Usually this is an option given to the officers to make some money).[There is a list of 9 documents required by the corporation in some cases for ""thorough verification"" - you can find that list in tamil in the website].

Usually, generation of a new birth registration and issuance of a certificate takes almost two months. If there is a work load, which you can expect there to be if the CAA/NRC proceeds in full steam, the time for issuance can be expected to be almost tripled. 

So act soon, get your affairs in order and help to get your neighbor/friend their documents ready. Spread the awareness. Dont let them be a prey to the brokers who thrive on emergency/desperate situations to charge a fucking lumpsum towards a simple job.

**Tl;dr**

IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   


**Essential First Principles**

As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  


In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   


**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**

Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  


*1.    Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*

The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  


*2.*   *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*

Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  


*3.*   *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*

A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  


*4.   Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*

* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.
* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.
* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   


*5.*   *The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*

The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “**reasonable purposes**” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces**.  


In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.
